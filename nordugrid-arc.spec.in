%description
NorduGrid is a collaboration aiming at development, maintenance and
support of the free Grid middleware, known as the Advanced Resource
Connector (ARC).

The Advanced Resource Connector (ARC) brings computing resources
together across institutional boundaries. This concept is commonly
referred to as a "computational grid". Historically, grids address the
organization of distributed storage of data and parallel computation,
but could be expanded to arbitrary services.

Just like the web, ARC has its roots in the IT infrastructure that was
erected to analyze the experiments for high energy physics at CERN.
The first release, ARC-0.x, was dependent on Globus, the current
release keeps that compatibility but can also be used independently.

For grid computing, a major challenge is to keep the working environments
homogeneous between the sites. To help this situation, runtime
environments have been developed. Those can be added to or removed from
a site, and this Janitor service helps automating this process.

The Janitor is a recent development and the community to prepare
catalogs of dynamically installable packages still needs to evolve.

Advanced Resource Connector (ARC)

Release Notes for NorduGrid ARC 6.0.0a1     12 November 2018
-----------------------------------------------------------
After a long ARC 6 preparation period, we are finally ready to announce the very first test release of ARC 6: the alpha release (6.0.0a1)

ARC 6 contains major improvements in the deployment, configuration and maintenance of ARC CE. It also comes with new features and services while some legacy features have been removed.

Although there has been some major re-engineering in the code base (see below), the interfaces are unchanged - ARC 5 clients are compatible with an ARC 6 CE and vice versa.

As of the 6.0.0a1 test release most of the planned development is completed, only smaller adjustments and some code cleanup is missing. Since July University of Oslo has been running ARC 6 with regular nightly updates.

Next step is to deploy this first test release on other sites, more sites deploying ARC 6 will mean more deployment, configuration and usage pattern are to be covered, more bugs discovered and fixed. So please volunteer to give it a try!


Important Changes
-----------------

The most important things to bear in mind if you are used to ARC 5:

* Complete overhaul of configuration
* Runtime environments (RTEs) must be explicitly enabled through the arcctl tool
* The NorduGrid schema is no longer published by default - it must be enabled via the [infosys/nordugrid] block
* Gridmap files (although still supported) are no longer recommended. VO-based authorisation should be configured as described in [ref to arc6 doc]
* Validation of the ARC configuration is enforced by A-REX startup scripts. If you have configuration errors then A-REX will not start.
* Renaming of startup scripts and default log files


Improvements and new features
-----------------------------

* Major server-side configuration changes
** Configuration has been cleaned up, regrouped and made more streamlined.
** ARC now comes with a so-called zero configuration - a preconfigured minimal ARC setup. Automatically installed with ARC, including test-CA and test host certificate for immediate test submission.
** ARC now operates with a so-called running configuration which is based on arc.conf (which is to be manually edited by the system administrator) but in addition includes any unchanged default values present in ARC. You can get a dump of the running configuration using the arcctl tool.
** Default values have had a big tidy up and are now handled consistently throughout ARC.

* The RTE framework has got a redesigned architecture and largely extended functionality (default, installed, enabled RTEs, introduction of RTE prameters)

* A new server-side control tool: arcctl has been developed. With this tool you can handle the configuration, the RTEs, the jobs, and many other things related to running an ARC CE.

* Two new submission interfaces have been included:
 ** The REST interface - enabled together with the A-Rex Web-Service.
 ** The INTERNAL interface - a special interface aimed for restrictive HPC sites, to be used with a local installation of the ARC Control Tower.


* ARCHERY has been introduced as the new DNS-based service indexing catalogue retiring the ldap-based EGIIS

* The internal job-loop in A-Rex has been re-engineered to be event-driven in order to improve scalability. 

* Packaging has been restructured:
** Streamlined package name scheme
** ldap services have been separated out, as for instance WS and INTERNAL submission do not need ldap.
** The INTERNAL submission plugin is separately packaged.





Documentation
---------------
Please note that documentation is not complete, but you can what is available here: http://www.nordugrid.org/documents/arc6/index.html
For a quick installation guide, have a look at http://www.nordugrid.org/documents/arc6/user/try_arc6.html

Note that with ARC 6 you must enable the RTE's you need as a separate step after installation.
See documentation in: http://www.nordugrid.org/documents/arc6/user/rtes.html


Parts of the old documentation available from http://www.nordugrid.org/documents/arc-ce-sysadm-guide.pdf is still relevant, but there are not guarantees.

We are working on cleaning up the documentation.

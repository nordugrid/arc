Release Notes for NorduGrid ARC  6.17.0     XX.XX.XXXX
=======================================================


Highlights in this release
--------------------------
ARC now correctly parses multiple checksums, avoiding download failures that otherwise occured. (Bug 4094)

A long-standing bug in ARC caused a large amount of empty job description files to be produced under certain circumstances.
This situation is now handled properly by ARC, and the files should no longer be produced. (Bug 4098) 

The following Bugzilla tickets have been adressed or solved
------------------------------------------------------------
* 4098  0 size job description files being created - and overpopulating controldir
* 4094  ARC doesn't handle multiple checksums exposed through webdav



Documentation
==============
The ARC 6 documentation can be found at http://www.nordugrid.org/arc/arc6

If you miss something or have questions, please contact us!


Installing ARC 6 
=================
We recommend to install ARC release using the Nordugrid repository.
* Start with the basics: http://www.nordugrid.org/arc/arc6/admins/try_arc6.html
* Get production ready: http://www.nordugrid.org/arc/arc6/admins/arc6_install_guide.html 

Note that if you instead install from EPEL for RHEL 7 compatible systems,
the ARC 6 packages can be found as nordugrid-arc6-* and not nordugrid-arc-*
This was needed in order to supply both ARC 5 already available for RHEL7 and the new ARC 6.


We provide binary builds for all supported versions of
  * Debian (i386 and amd64)
  * Fedora (x86_64)
  * Centos/RHEL (x86_64)
  * Ubuntu (i386 and amd64, both LTS and interim releases) - from Ubuntu 20.04 no i386 support

In addition we build nightly packages for older platforms.

Future support of ARC 5-series
===============================
As of June 2020 no more security updates are provided to ARC 5.
Also since the release of ARC 6 in June 2019, no more development on the ARC 5 code base has been provided.

Production Sites already running ARC 5 will still get operational site support in form of
deployment and configuration troubleshooting help via GGUS until end June 2021.
However, we may recommend upgrading to ARC 6 depending on the issues the site is facing. 

ARC5 is available in EPEL7 and will stay there. EPEL8 will only contain ARC 6.
To install ARC 6 from EPEL7 the package-names are of type: nordugrid-arc6-* 




Known issues
==============
* In Centos8 the openldap server is not installable because slapd is not available in the RHEL8 release (Bugzilla 3944).
  As a consequence, the LDAP-based server-side information system interface of the ARC-CE will not be available either.
  If interaction with the ARC-CE relies on LDAP-based information schemas (glue1.3 or nordugrid schema),
  then we recommend that you stay with Centos7 for the time being.
* Related to the new accounting system introduded in release 6.4.0: 
  * Accounting records created by ARC 6.4.0 are affected by a bug causing missing benchmark values:
   https://bugzilla.nordugrid.org./show_bug.cgi?id=3921#c3
   Recommendations are to update to a newer version of ARC.
   The bugreport gives instructions on how to manually fix the wrong benchmark values.

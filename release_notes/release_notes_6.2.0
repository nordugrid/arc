Advanced Resource Connector (ARC)
=================================


Release Notes for NorduGrid ARC  6.2.0     30.08.2019
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

We are happy to announce the ARC 6.2.0 release, which includes some bugfixes and enhancements to 6.1.0. 


Highlights in this release
* The way SLURM handles environment variables caused failure in ENV/PROXY updates.
  A workaround was provided for ARC 6.1 through arc.conf by setting slurm_requirements=--export=None in the [lrms] block.
  Now this workaround is no longer needed as the backend script is fixed.



The following Bugzilla tickets have been resolved
---------------------------------------------------
* 3544  Patch for BDII Job Count Breakdown
* 3845  Provide a hook for an external agent to change DTR priorities
* 3844  arex and gridftpd services fail to start due to python version
* 3850  SLURM backend copies ARC CE environment causing updated ENV/PROXY failure
* 3851  Gridftp submission stops working when per-queue allowaccess is enabled
* 3849  Mystery bug: custom BDII PIDFile location causes infosys directory chown to root at each infoproviders run
* 3848  Dummy RTE can stop other RTE from being processed by submission scripts




In addition the following enhancements and changes are included, together with some other minor improvements


* Component:  Arcctl
**  Adding new features to arcctl job management script for rendering stdout/stderr                   

* Component:  Accounting

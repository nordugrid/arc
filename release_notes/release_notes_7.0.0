Backwards compatibilities and incompatibilities
------------------------------------------------

ARC7 still suports x509 proxies in addition to the tokens.

new blocks to enable/disable the authentication methods: [authtokens] [authx509], zero conf turns on both?? 

Support for the EMIES interface was completely removed. 

Publshing cluster information via REST interface is enabled by default [arex/ws/publicinfo] block is added to zero.conf

No incompatible changes in the ARC7 accounting subsystem. APEL and SGAS supported.

the internal structure of the controldir files have been changed, ARC internal scripts were updated but custom scripts may be broken because of the changed file structure in the controldir.

ARC 7 supports XRSL and ADL as job description languages, no backward incompatible changes were introduced, all ARC6 job files should work with ARC7. 

ARC 7 fully supports the SLURM, Condor and the fork batch systems and community efforts were made to provide some maintenance for OpenPBS as well. The other batch systems from ARC6 are kept in ARC7 but their status is unclear.

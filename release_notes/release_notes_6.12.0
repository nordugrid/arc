Release Notes for NorduGrid ARC  6.12.0     07.06.2021
=======================================================


Highlights in this release
--------------------------
This release accomodates the EGI campaign for APEL to migrate from ActiveMQ messages brokers to ARGO messaging service.

If you publish accounts to APEL, please be aware that you must update in good time before July 1st which is when the ARGO team will deactivate the ActiveMQ message brokers. 


**Note that you must change your arc.conf for the APEL changes to work**

If you fail to do so, the accounting records will not be publised in APEL.
Nevertheless all job records will be kept locally and after fixing the config those records will be picked up and will be registered.

Alter the APEL target config as follows:

[arex/jura/apel: KEEPOLDNAME]
# change targeturl to ARGO AMS endpoint
targeturl = https://msg.argo.grnet.gr
# delete 'topic' to rely on default
# keep same apel_messages type if you have it defined

An example of a resulting config could look like this:

[arex/jura/apel: KEEPOLDNAME]
targeturl = https://msg.argo.grnet.gr
apel_messages = summaries

What to check:
- jura.log for successful publishing
- "arcctl accounting republish" some data and check that it works
- open a ticket in GGUS for  APEL to correlate the data and ensure that messages reaching ARGO AMS actually reaches the APEL database.

Documentation
==============
The ARC 6 documentation can be found at http://www.nordugrid.org/arc/arc6

If you miss something or have questions, please contact us!


Installing ARC 6 
=================
We recommend to install ARC release using the Nordugrid repository.
* Start with the basics: http://www.nordugrid.org/arc/arc6/admins/try_arc6.html
* Get production ready: http://www.nordugrid.org/arc/arc6/admins/arc6_install_guide.html 

Note that if you instead install from EPEL for RHEL 7 compatible systems,
the ARC 6 packages can be found as nordugrid-arc6-* and not nordugrid-arc-*
This was needed in order to supply both ARC 5 already available for RHEL7 and the new ARC 6.


We provide binary builds for all supported versions of
  * Debian (i386 and amd64)
  * Fedora (x86_64)
  * Centos/RHEL (x86_64)
  * Ubuntu (i386 and amd64, both LTS and interim releases) - from Ubuntu 20.04 no i386 support

In addition we build nightly packages for older platforms. 


Contributing
=============
You can submit pull requests to our public repo at https://github.com/nordugrid/arc which mirrors
our GitLab repo https://source.coderefinery.org/nordugrid/arc.

The pull requests will be automatically copied over to our Gitlab repo where they will be
merged into the source-code if accepted.


Getting in touch
==================
If you need help with the configuration file or have any other questions related to ARC 6, please contact us via
* Email: nordugrid-discuss@nordugrid.org or wlcg-arc-ce-discuss@cern.ch
* Skype channel dedicated to ARC 6 support: https://join.skype.com/dyf3A6Uutjy2


Future support of ARC 5-series
===============================
As of June 2020 no more security updates are provided to ARC 5.
Also since the release of ARC 6 in June 2019, no more development on the ARC 5 code base has been provided.

Production Sites already running ARC 5 will still get operational site support in form of
deployment and configuration troubleshooting help via GGUS until end June 2021.
However, we may recommend upgrading to ARC 6 depending on the issues the site is facing. 

ARC5 is available in EPEL7 and will stay there. EPEL8 will only contain ARC 6.
To install ARC 6 from EPEL7 the package-names are of type: nordugrid-arc6-* 




Known issues
==============
* In Centos8 the openldap server is not installable because slapd is not available in the RHEL8 release (Bugzilla 3944).
  As a consequence, the LDAP-based server-side information system interface of the ARC-CE will not be available either.
  If interaction with the ARC-CE relies on LDAP-based information schemas (glue1.3 or nordugrid schema),
  then we recommend that you stay with Centos7 for the time being.
* Related to the new accounting system introduded in release 6.4.0: 
  * Accounting records created by ARC 6.4.0 are affected by a bug causing missing benchmark values.
    Details can be found here: http://www.nordugrid.org/documents/arc6/admins/details/accounting-benchmark.html
   Recommendations are to update to a newer version of ARC.
   The bugreport gives instructions on how to manually fix the wrong benchmark values.

Highlights in this release
--------------------------
This release accomodates the EGI campaign for APEL to migrate from ActiveMQ messages brokers to ARGO messaging service.

Please keep an eye on the annoucements from EGI regarding this.

Documentation
==============
The ARC 6 documentation can be found at http://www.nordugrid.org/arc/arc6

If you miss something or have questions, please contact us!


Installing ARC 6 
=================
We recommend to install ARC release using the Nordugrid repository.
* Start with the basics: http://www.nordugrid.org/arc/arc6/admins/try_arc6.html
* Get production ready: http://www.nordugrid.org/arc/arc6/admins/arc6_install_guide.html 

Note that if you instead install from EPEL for RHEL 7 compatible systems,
the ARC 6 packages can be found as nordugrid-arc6-* and not nordugrid-arc-*
This was needed in order to supply both ARC 5 already available for RHEL7 and the new ARC 6.


We provide binary builds for all supported versions of
  * Debian (i386 and amd64)
  * Fedora (x86_64)
  * Centos/RHEL (x86_64)
  * Ubuntu (i386 and amd64, both LTS and interim releases) - from Ubuntu 20.04 no i386 support

In addition we build nightly packages for older platforms.

Future support of ARC 5-series
===============================
As of June 2020 no more security updates are provided to ARC 5.
Also since the release of ARC 6 in June 2019, no more development on the ARC 5 code base has been provided.

Production Sites already running ARC 5 will still get operational site support in form of
deployment and configuration troubleshooting help via GGUS until end June 2021.
However, we may recommend upgrading to ARC 6 depending on the issues the site is facing. 

ARC5 is available in EPEL7 and will stay there. EPEL8 will only contain ARC 6.
To install ARC 6 from EPEL7 the package-names are of type: nordugrid-arc6-* 




Known issues
==============
* In Centos8 the openldap server is not installable because slapd is not available in the RHEL8 release (Bugzilla 3944).
  As a consequence, the LDAP-based server-side information system interface of the ARC-CE will not be available either.
  If interaction with the ARC-CE relies on LDAP-based information schemas (glue1.3 or nordugrid schema),
  then we recommend that you stay with Centos7 for the time being.
* Related to the new accounting system introduded in release 6.4.0: 
  * Accounting records created by ARC 6.4.0 are affected by a bug causing missing benchmark values:
   https://bugzilla.nordugrid.org./show_bug.cgi?id=3921#c3
   Recommendations are to update to a newer version of ARC.
   The bugreport gives instructions on how to manually fix the wrong benchmark values.

Advanced Resource Connector (ARC)

Release Notes for NorduGrid ARC  6.6.0     24.04.2020
------------------------------------------------------
We are happy to announce the release of ARC 6.6.0 which comes with a couple of new features and a handful of bug fixes. 

Highlights in this release
--------------------------
In this release we offer the very first technological preview of the handling of OIDC tokens in ARC. With it comes a new configuration option enabling the feature. Please see the documentation http://www.nordugrid.org/documents/arc6/misc/oidc_tokens.html for how to use tokens with ARC.

We have also implemented the possibility to obtain generic resource information about the cluster without the need of being authenticated and or authorized. This feature is configurable in arc.conf

A few bugs were also fixed, see the list of tickets. 

The following Bugzilla tickets have been adressed or solved
------------------------------------------------------------
* 3917  Anonymous access to cluster information through EMI ES interface.
* 3916  Support for OIDC tokens in ARC
* 3913  python3 packages for ubuntu (solved)
* 3911  Issue with arcctl deploy voms-lsc from EGI database (solved)
* 3910  Wrong type for RR type in archery-manage raw data check (solved)

Documentation
==============
The ARC 6 documentation can be found at http://www.nordugrid.org/arc/arc6

If you miss something or have questions, please contact us!


Installing ARC 6 
=================
We recommend to install ARC release using the Nordugrid repository.
* Start with the basics: http://www.nordugrid.org/arc/arc6/admins/try_arc6.html
* Get production ready: http://www.nordugrid.org/arc/arc6/admins/arc6_install_guide.html 

Note that if you instead install from EPEL for RHEL 7 compatible systems,
the ARC 6 packages can be found as nordugrid-arc6-* and not nordugrid-arc-*
This was needed in order to supply both ARC 5 already available for RHEL7 and the new ARC 6.


We provide binary builds for all supported versions of
  * Debian (i386 and amd64)
  * Fedora (i386 and x86_64)
  * CentOS EL6 (i386 and x86_64) and EL7/EL8 (x86_64)
  * Ubuntu (i386 and amd64, both LTS and interim releases)

In addition we build nightly packages for older platforms. 

Future support of ARC 5-series
===============================
Note that now that ARC 6 is released, we will only provide security updates of ARC 5.
In particular:
1) No new feature development is planned or going on for ARC5 and no bug-fixing development 
   will happen on ARC5 code base in the future except for security issues.
2) Security fixes for ARC5 will be provided till end of June 2020.
3) Production Sites already running ARC 5 will be able to get deployment and configuration 
   troubleshooting help via GGUS till end June 2021. This we call "operational site support".
4) ARC5 is available in EPEL7 and will stay there. EPEL8 will only contain ARC 6.

Release Notes for NorduGrid ARC  6.10.1     12.02.2021
=======================================================

After the brief release of ARC 6.10.0 and the retraction quickly
after, this release tackles the slowness encountered from the hashing code
related to Bug 3980 (GDPR). 

We at the same time spotted a problem in the Accounting code which also
has been fixed, see Bug 3992.

Highlights in this release
--------------------------
There are two important updates in this release.
The first handles the submitter information in regards to GDPR,
and the second fixes a bug causing AREX to crash.

1. Submitters certificate DN and GDPR (Bugzilla 3980)
   With ARC 6.10.0 the submitters DN is now exposed in a hashed format.
   This means that ARC no longer publishes the submitters DN in clear text
   and therefore complies with GDPR regulations.
   Note that the arcsync command from ARC clients version <= 6.9.0 will not work,
   as the DN's no longer will match. Updating the ARC client is required for arcsync to work.

2. AREX crashes related to the security processing in AREX (Bugzilla 3978)
   Some sites experienced regular AREX crashes with the ARC 6.9.0 release.
   This was due to a bug in the code which handled the detection of failure in the security processing.
   This is now fixed. 

In addition to these important changes, the release contains several other bugfixes and improvements as
can be seen in the list of adressed Bugzilla tickets below. 




The following Bugzilla tickets have been adressed or solved
------------------------------------------------------------
* 3993  The amount of fork calls to sha512sum was slowing down infoproviders
* 3992  Wrong function call in AccountingDBAsync
* 3987  AREX crashes - nightlies 20200120 - libcrypto
* 3979  output files with davs:// destination created with wrong filename
* 3978  Bug in detecting security processing failure in A-REX
* 3976  double submission to slurm
* 3962  Arex crash caused by memory leaks with many open handles - nightlies 20200921020916
The following Bugzilla tickets have been partly resolved: 
* 3980  nordugrid-job-globalowner of the nordugrid ldap schema is not GDPR compliant
* 3974  cache info is not published
* 3929  GLUE2ComputingShareMaxMainMemory, GLUE2ComputingShareMaxVirtualMemory  and GLUE2ExecutionEnvironmentMainMemorySize affected by homogeneity



Documentation
==============
The ARC 6 documentation can be found at http://www.nordugrid.org/arc/arc6

If you miss something or have questions, please contact us!


Installing ARC 6 
=================
We recommend to install ARC release using the Nordugrid repository.
* Start with the basics: http://www.nordugrid.org/arc/arc6/admins/try_arc6.html
* Get production ready: http://www.nordugrid.org/arc/arc6/admins/arc6_install_guide.html 

Note that if you instead install from EPEL for RHEL 7 compatible systems,
the ARC 6 packages can be found as nordugrid-arc6-* and not nordugrid-arc-*
This was needed in order to supply both ARC 5 already available for RHEL7 and the new ARC 6.


We provide binary builds for all supported versions of
  * Debian (i386 and amd64)
  * Fedora (x86_64)
  * Centos/RHEL (x86_64)
  * Ubuntu (i386 and amd64, both LTS and interim releases) - from Ubuntu 20.04 no i386 support

In addition we build nightly packages for older platforms. 


Future support of ARC 5-series
===============================
As of June 2020 no more security updates are provided to ARC 5.
Also since the release of ARC 6 in June 2019, no more development on the ARC 5 code base has been provided.

Production Sites already running ARC 5 will still get operational site support in form of
deployment and configuration troubleshooting help via GGUS until end June 2021.
However, we may recommend upgrading to ARC 6 depending on the issues the site is facing. 

ARC5 is available in EPEL7 and will stay there. EPEL8 will only contain ARC 6.
To install ARC 6 from EPEL7 the package-names are of type: nordugrid-arc6-* 


Getting in touch
==================
If you need help with the configuration file or have any other questions related to ARC 6, please contact us via
* Email: nordugrid-discuss@nordugrid.org or wlcg-arc-ce-discuss@cern.ch
* Skype channel dedicated to ARC 6 support: https://join.skype.com/dyf3A6Uutjy2


Known issues
==============
* The arcsync command from ARC clients version <= 6.9.0 will not work together
  with ARC >=6.10.0 sites. This is due to the hashing of the submitters DN from ARC version 6.10.0.
  Updating the ARC client is required for arcsync to work.
* In Centos8 the openldap server is not installable because slapd is not available in the RHEL8 release (Bugzilla 3944).
  As a consequence, the LDAP-based server-side information system interface of the ARC-CE will not be available either.
  If interaction with the ARC-CE relies on LDAP-based information schemas (glue1.3 or nordugrid schema),
  then we recommend that you stay with Centos7 for the time being.
* Related to the new accounting system introduded in release 6.4.0: 
  * Accounting records created by ARC 6.4.0 are affected by a bug causing missing benchmark values:
   https://bugzilla.nordugrid.org./show_bug.cgi?id=3921#c3
   Recommendations are to update to a newer version of ARC.
   The bugreport gives instructions on how to manually fix the wrong benchmark values.

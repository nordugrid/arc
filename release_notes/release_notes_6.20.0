Release Notes for NorduGrid ARC  6.20.0    25.06.2024
=======================================================
Several important updates in this release. See below in highlights and Bugzilla tickets.


Highlights in this release
--------------------------
The most important changes in this release are the configurable support of APEL version (Bugzilla 4184), in addition to correcting an unintended side-effect of a fix to Bugzilla ticket 4143 where arcget for jobs submitted via HTTPS do not gransfer gmlog (Bugzilla 4161).

For the APEL related bugifx: the default is now v0.2 which is the current APEL format version, while v0.4 can be configured in arc.conf.
The configuration is done in the "[arex/jura/apel]" block and the "apel_messages" option. If you do not set the apel_messages option, the default "summaries" value corresponding to v0.2 is used. If you want to use v0.4 use the "summaries-v04" instead.

Note that APEL does not yet support the v0.4 in their production instance. 



The following Bugzilla tickets have been adressed or solved
------------------------------------------------------------
* 4184  APEL v0.2 and v0.4 support
* 4168  "arcctl service restart -a" fails to start, with multiple 'cachedir' in '[arex/cache]'
* 4166  Misspelling of special targets in unit files
* 4167  Missing dependency ordering on nss-lookup.target for arc-infosys-ldap-slapd.service 
* 4161  arcget and gmlog WARNING messages and job failure in ARC 6.19.0
* 4149  Escaping apostrophe in signing policy
* 4116  GLUE2 info system is inconsistent between ARC6 and ARC7 wrt to existing and published ForeignKeys



Documentation
==============
The ARC 6 documentation can be found at http://www.nordugrid.org/arc/arc6

If you miss something or have questions, please contact us!


Installing ARC 6 
=================
We recommend to install ARC release using the Nordugrid repository.
* Start with the basics: http://www.nordugrid.org/arc/arc6/admins/try_arc6.html
* Get production ready: http://www.nordugrid.org/arc/arc6/admins/arc6_install_guide.html 

Note that if you instead install from EPEL for RHEL 7 compatible systems,
the ARC 6 packages can be found as nordugrid-arc6-* and not nordugrid-arc-*
This was needed in order to supply both ARC 5 already available for RHEL7 and the new ARC 6.


We provide binary builds for all supported versions of
  * Debian (i386 and amd64)
  * Fedora (x86_64)
  * Centos/RHEL (x86_64)
  * Ubuntu (i386 and amd64, both LTS and interim releases) - from Ubuntu 20.04 no i386 support

In addition we build nightly packages for older platforms.

The support policy of ARC 6 will follow the same policy we had for ARC 5: 1 year security updates, no more development of ARC 6 once ARC 7 is out.

Installing from EPEL:
----------------------
Once the release is out, it can be installed from EPEL using package-name types: nordugrid-arc7-*


Future support of ARC 5-series
===============================
As of June 2020 no more security updates are provided to ARC 5.
Also since the release of ARC 6 in June 2019, no more development on the ARC 5 code base has been provided.


ARC5 is available in EPEL7 and will stay there. EPEL8 will only contain ARC 6.
To install ARC 6 from EPEL7 the package-names are of type: nordugrid-arc6-* 



Known issues
==============
* Related to the accounting system introduded in release 6.4.0: 
  * Accounting records created by ARC 6.4.0 are affected by a bug causing missing benchmark values:

Advanced Resource Connector (ARC)
=================================


Release Notes for NorduGrid ARC  6.8.0     23.09.2020
------------------------------------------------------


Highlights in this release
--------------------------

Note about Centos8 and openldap server
---------------------------------------

In Centos8 the openldap server is not installable because slapd is not available in the RHEL8 release (Bugzilla #3944).
As a consequence, the LDAP-based server-side information system interface of the ARC-CE will not be available either.
If interaction with the ARC-CE relies on LDAP-based information schemas (glue1.3 or nordugrid schema),
then we recommend that you stay with Centos7 for the time being.

We expect to provide a workaround for future releases.


The following Bugzilla tickets have been adressed or solved
------------------------------------------------------------
* 3956  Checksum is not correctly passed to xrootd libraries
* 3953  Cancelling a job in Preparing (pending) has no effect
* 3952  EMI-ES reports cancelled jobs as FAILED
* 3951  cleanup controldir
* 3950  log_failure_msg used in /usr/share/arc/arc-acix-scanner-start without being defined
* 3949  option to sbatch
* 3948  GRID_GLOBAL_JOBID is not full job id in EMI-ES
* 3946  Running arcctl commands as normal user silently fails
* 3942  Failed listing directory on GridFTP server
* 3940  startTime has no effect in EMIES/ADL


Documentation

Installing ARC 6 
=================
We recommend to install ARC release using the Nordugrid repository.
* Start with the basics: http://www.nordugrid.org/arc/arc6/admins/try_arc6.html
* Get production ready: http://www.nordugrid.org/arc/arc6/admins/arc6_install_guide.html 

Note that if you instead install from EPEL for RHEL 7 compatible systems,
the ARC 6 packages can be found as nordugrid-arc6-* and not nordugrid-arc-*
This was needed in order to supply both ARC 5 already available for RHEL7 and the new ARC 6.


We provide binary builds for all supported versions of
  * Debian (i386 and amd64)
  * Fedora (i386 and x86_64) - from Fedora 26 - no i386 support
  * CentOS EL6 (i386 and x86_64) and EL7/EL8 (x86_64) - from EL7 no i386 support
  * Ubuntu (i386 and amd64, both LTS and interim releases) - from Ubuntu 20.40 no i386 support

In addition we build nightly packages for older platforms. 

Future support of ARC 5-series
===============================
As of June 2020 no more security updates are provided to ARC 5.
Also since the release of ARC 6 in June 2019, no more development on the ARC 5 code base has been provided.

Production Sites already running ARC 5 will still get operational site support in form of
deployment and configuration troubleshooting help via GGUS until end June 2021.
However, we may recommend upgrading to ARC 6 depending on the issues the site is facing. 

ARC5 is available in EPEL7 and will stay there. EPEL8 will only contain ARC 6.
To install ARC 6 from EPEL7 the package-names are of type: nordugrid-arc6-*

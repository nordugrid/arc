Advanced Resource Connector (ARC)
=================================


Release Notes for NorduGrid ARC  6.9.0     30.11.2020
------------------------------------------------------
We are pleased to announce the release of ARC 6.9.0.


Highlights in this release
---------------------------


REST interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this release the main highlight is a technical preview of the REST interface.
The specifications are detailed here: http://www.nordugrid.org/documents/arc6/tech/rest/rest.html
To try out the REST interface, install the nordugrid-arc-plugins-arcrest package. 

Note that this is a new implementation replacing the earlier REST technical preview implementation.

We are keen for feedback to this interface, and expect a standard version to be ready in the new year. 


arcctl datadelivery
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some changes and improvements have been done to the arcctl datastaging tool.
Note that some options have now changed names, to hopefully better describe the function.


arc.conf
~~~~~~~~~
A new option has been added to the lrms block of arc.conf, namely movetool (Bugzilla 3239).
This allows you  to specify what move-tool AREX will use when moving files from the sessiondir
to the scratchdir. This option is only relevant if you have scratchdir enabled.

------------------------------------------------------------
* 3970  REST interface reimplementation
* 3965  multiple 'du' on cache
* 3964  Time zone issue in arcctl datastaging job time
* 3393  Possible data corruption bug in arccp

Documentation
==============
The ARC 6 documentation can be found at http://www.nordugrid.org/arc/arc6

If you miss something or have questions, please contact us!


Installing ARC 6 
=================
We recommend to install ARC release using the Nordugrid repository.
* Start with the basics: http://www.nordugrid.org/arc/arc6/admins/try_arc6.html
* Get production ready: http://www.nordugrid.org/arc/arc6/admins/arc6_install_guide.html 

Note that if you instead install from EPEL for RHEL 7 compatible systems,
the ARC 6 packages can be found as nordugrid-arc6-* and not nordugrid-arc-*
This was needed in order to supply both ARC 5 already available for RHEL7 and the new ARC 6.


We provide binary builds for all supported versions of
  * Debian (i386 and amd64)
  * Fedora (x86_64)
  * Centos/RHEL (x86_64)
  * Ubuntu (i386 and amd64, both LTS and interim releases) - from Ubuntu 20.04 no i386 support

In addition we build nightly packages for older platforms. 

Future support of ARC 5-series
===============================
Note that now that ARC 6 is released, we will only provide security updates of ARC 5.
In particular:
1) No new feature development is planned or going on for ARC5 and no bug-fixing development 
   will happen on ARC5 code base in the future except for security issues.
2) Security fixes for ARC5 will be provided till end of June 2020.
3) Production Sites already running ARC 5 will be able to get deployment and configuration 
   troubleshooting help via GGUS till end June 2021. This we call "operational site support".
4) ARC5 is available in EPEL7 and will stay there. EPEL8 will only contain ARC 6.

Release Notes for NorduGrid ARC  6.21.1    10.12.2024
=======================================================

This patch release solves the problems introduced in 6.21.0 related to the changes to the infosys for Bugzilla ticket 4196. 

Several problems were discovered, and the relevant block in info.xml now has a different format compared to the first attempt. 
There is now one OtherInfo entry per internal AREX job state - and as before, per share. 
In addition we have added the same metrics for any vomsvo's defined. 

The possible states are: 
INLRMS:Q
INLRMS:R
INLRMS:O
INLRMS:E
INLRMS:S
PREPARING
FINISHING


Here is a snippet of how the information could look like in info.xml: 

 <ComputingShare BaseType="Share" CreationTime="2024-12-10T09:46:11Z" Validity="10800">
            <ID>urn:ogf:ComputingShare:arctest-el7:main</ID>
            <Name>main</Name>
            <OtherInfo>CoreCount=INLRMS:R=1</OtherInfo>
            <OtherInfo>CoreCount=INLRMS:Q=3</OtherInfo>
            <OtherInfo>CoreCount=PREPARING=2</OtherInfo>
            <OtherInfo>CoreCount=FINISHING=5</OtherInfo>

Documentation
==============
The ARC 6 documentation can be found at http://www.nordugrid.org/arc/arc6

If you miss something or have questions, please contact us!


Installing ARC 6
=================
We recommend to install ARC release using the Nordugrid repository.
* Start with the basics: http://www.nordugrid.org/arc/arc6/admins/try_arc6.html
* Get production ready: http://www.nordugrid.org/arc/arc6/admins/arc6_install_guide.html

Note that if you instead install from EPEL for RHEL 7 compatible systems,
the ARC 6 packages can be found as nordugrid-arc6-* and not nordugrid-arc-*
This was needed in order to supply both ARC 5 already available for RHEL7 and the new ARC 6.


We provide binary builds for all supported versions of
  * Debian (i386 and amd64)
  * Fedora (x86_64)
  * Centos/RHEL (x86_64)
  * Ubuntu (i386 and amd64, both LTS and interim releases) - from Ubuntu 20.04 no i386 support

In addition we build nightly packages for older platforms.

The support policy of ARC 6 will follow the same policy we had for ARC 5: 1 year security updates, no more development of ARC 6 once ARC 7 is out.

Installing from EPEL:
----------------------
Once the release is out, it can be installed from EPEL using package-name types: nordugrid-arc7-*

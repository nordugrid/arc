As several developers are expected to work on this, a central development branch has been created. 
You can commit by direct push. 

Please keep the branch up to date with master following the usual procedures for a development branch

Once the work is done the branch will be merged back into master, and also into the "next" branch. 

This file should be removed before merging into master.

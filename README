What is the ARC Middleware
==========================
The Advanced Resource Connector (ARC) middleware, developed by the
NorduGrid Collaboration (<http://www.nordugrid.org>), is an open source software
solution enabling e-Science computing infrastructures with emphasis on
processing of large data volumes. 
ARC is being used to enable national and international e-infrastructures
since its first release in 2002.


License
=======
The software code is released under the Apache 2.0 License (see the
LICENSE file). 
The necessary 3rd party libraries are usually available in standard
Linux distributions; in rare cases NorduGrid repositories offer them.


Getting the software
====================
All the information about how to get the software is available at

  <http://www.nordugrid.org/arc/>


Installation and Configuration
==============================
If you are new to ARC and want to give a quick try then please follow our 
quickstart guide that will give you an ARC Computing Element and introduce you 
to typical distributed computing workflows in just a few minutes!

QUICKSTART GUIDE:

For production Computing Element deployment follow the 
Installation and Configuration Guide that contains the pointers to precise 
configuration of every ARC subsystem.

Contributing
============
The open source development of the ARC middleware is coordinated by
the NorduGrid Collaboration. The Technical Coordination Group (TCG) defines 
outstanding issues that have to be addressed in the framework of ARC development. 
Contributions from the community to the software and the documentation
is welcomed. Sources can be downloaded from the Coderefinery gitlab repository
at 

ARC SOURCE:

Ongoing and completed e-Science research projects and student 
assignments related to the middleware are listed
on the NorduGrid web site: <http://www.nordugrid.org>


Support, Mailing lists
==============================================
User support and site installation assistance is provided via 
several mailing lists, among which the nordugrid-discuss mailing list 
is a general forum for all kind of issues related to the ARC middleware. 

MAILING LISTS:
  <https://mail.nordugrid.org/mailman/listinfo>

The Bugzilla problem tracking system accepts requests for features or 
enhancements, and it is also the prime medium to track and report problems.

Documentation
=============
Research papers, overview talks, reference manuals, user guides,
installation instructions, conference presentations, FAQ and even
tutorial materials can be fetched from the documentation section of the website.

What is the ARC Middleware
==========================
The Advanced Resource Connector (ARC) middleware, developed by the
NorduGrid Collaboration (<httpwww.nordugrid.org>), is an open source software
solution enabling e-Science computing infrastructures with emphasis on
processing of large data volumes. 
ARC is being used to enable national and international e-infrastructures
since its first release in 2002.


License
=======
The software code is released under the Apache 2.0 License (see the
LICENSE file). 
The necessary 3rd party libraries are usually available in standard
Linux distributions; in rare cases NorduGrid repositories offer them.

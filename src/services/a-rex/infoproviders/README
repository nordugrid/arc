                 collectors and prints results in XML.

InfoCollector.pm  - base class for all information collectors (all files *Info.pm)
InfoChecker.pm  - used by InfoCollector to validate options and results against
                  a simple 'schema' (not XML Schema)

              user limits ...)

              such as:
    FORKmod.pm - Fork information module
    SGEmod.pm  - SGE information module
    ARC0mod.pm - special module that loads ARC0 information modules and does
                 the conversion between the old interface and the new one.
PBS.pm, LL.pm, LSF.pm, Condor.pm - ARC0 information modules

ARC0ClusterInfo.pm - combines all information about A-REX and produces
                     information structured according to the classic NG schema.
ARC1ClusterInfo.pm - combines all information about A-REX and produces
                     information structured according to the GLUE2 schema.

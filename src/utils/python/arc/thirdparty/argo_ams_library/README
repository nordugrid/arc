NorduGrid ARC distribution ships necessary thirdpatry ARGO AMS python library to submit records to APEL.
This is necessary thus we provides NorduGrid ARC packaging for number of platforms APEL is not packaged.

AMS libraries are developed by ARGOeu team and can be found at https://github.com/ARGOeu/argo-ams-library

In case of operating system has ARGO AMS libraries installed - these libraries will be used.

ARC redistributed libraries are used as a fallback option and targeted for OSes without ARGO AMS packaging support.

NorduGrid ARC distribution ships necessary thirdpatry APEL SSM python libraries to submit records to APEL.
This is necessary thus we provides NorduGrid ARC packaging for number of platforms APEL SSM is not packaged.

SSM libraries are developed by APEL team and can be found at https://github.com/apel/ssm

Following files are copied from APEL SSM codebase:
  __init__.py
  crypto.py
  ssm2.py

In case of operating system has APEL SSM libraries installed - these libraries will be used.

ARC redistributed libraries are used as a fallback option and targeted for OSes without APEL SSM packaging support.

Import statements in the redistibuted libraries are modified to match ARC usage pattern.
Thare can be also additional bugfixes in place compared to vanila version (depends on the exact verion).

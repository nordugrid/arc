[NAME]
arcsync \- ARC Synchronize

[EXTENDED DESCRIPTION]
The ARC CLI keeps a local database of active jobs in the users
home directory (see \fBarcsub\fR(1)). If this file is lost, or the user
wants to recreate the file on a different computer, the \fBarcsync\fR
command can be used to recreate the file from the information available
at the specified computing element or registry.

Since the information about a job retrieved from a CE can be
slightly out of date if the user very recently submitted or removed a
job a warning is issued when this command is run. The \fB--force\fR
option disables this warning.

If the joblist is not empty when invoking synchronization the old jobs
will be merged with the new jobs, unless the
.B --truncate
option is given, in which case the joblist will first be cleaned of old
jobs and then the new jobs will be added.

[FILES]
.TP
.B ~/.arc/client.conf
Some options can be given default values by specifying them in the
ARC client configuration file. By using the
.B --conffile
option a different configuration file can be used than the default.

.TP
.B ~/.arc/jobs.dat
This a local database of the user's active jobs. When a job is
successfully submitted it is added to database and when it is removed
from the remote CE it is removed from this list. This database is
used as the list of all active jobs when the user specifies the
.B --all
option to the various NorduGrid ARC user interface commands. By using the
.B --joblist
option a different file can be used than the default.

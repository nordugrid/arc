[NAME]
arctest \- ARC Test Suite

[EXTENDED DESCRIPTION]
The
.B arctest
command is mainly used for basic testing of job submission to ARC CE
using various pre-defined test jobs.  It supports all target selection 
options available for 
.B arcsub
and use the same brockering logic.

It can also print basic information
about user's certificate. The command is complementary to
.B arcinfo
and
.B arcproxy -I

The test jobs available in this version of arctest are:

Test job 1: This test-job calculates prime-numbers for a number of minutes given by
.B -r
(default 5) and outputs the list to stderr. The source-code for the prime-number
program, the Makefile and the executable are downloaded to the cluster from HTTP
and FTP servers and the program is compiled before running. In this way, the test
job constitutes a fairly comprehensive test of the basic setup of a grid cluster.

Test job 2: attempts to list all environment variables at the remote site

Test job 3: copies a remote file from an HTTP server into a local file

[EXAMPLES]
.br
\fBarctest -J 1 -C <computing element>\fR

will submit test job number 1 to the specified CE.

[FILES]
.TP
.B ~/.arc/client.conf
Some options can be given default values by specifying them in the
ARC client configuration file. By using the
.B --conffile
option a different configuration file can be used than the default.

.TP
.B ~/.arc/jobs.dat
This a local database of the user's active jobs. When a job is
successfully submitted it is added to database and when it is removed
from the remote CE it is removed from this list. This database is
used as the list of all active jobs when the user specifies the
.B --all
option to the various NorduGrid ARC user interface commands. By using the
.B --joblist
option a different file can be used than the default.

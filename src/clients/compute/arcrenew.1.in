.SH EXTENDED DESCRIPTION

The
.B arcrenew
command renews the delegated x509 proxy of a job submitted an ARC CEs.
The job can be referred to either by the jobid that was returned by
.BR arcsub (1)
at submission time or by its jobname if the job description that was
submitted contained a jobname attribute.

More than one jobid and/or jobname can be given. If several jobs were
submitted with the same jobname the proxies of all those jobs are
renewed. If the
.B --joblist
option is used the list of jobs is read from a file with the
specified filename. By specifying the
.B --all
option, the proxies of all active jobs will be renewed.

The
.B --computing-element
option can be used to select or reject jobs at specific clusters. The
.B --status
option can be used to select jobs in a specific state. These options
can be repeated several times. See
.BR arcstat (1)
for possible state values.

.SH FILES

.TP
.B ~/.arc/client.conf
Some options can be given default values by specifying them in the
ARC client configuration file. By using the
.B --conffile
option a different configuration file can be used than the default.

.TP
.B ~/.arc/jobs.dat
This a local database of the user's active jobs. When a job is
successfully submitted it is added to database and when it is removed
from the remote CE it is removed from this list. This database is
used as the list of all active jobs when the user specifies the
.B --all
option to the various NorduGrid ARC user interface commands. By using the
.B --joblist
option a different file can be used than the default.

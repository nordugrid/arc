.SH EXTENDED DESCRIPTION

The
.B arcstat
command gives the status of a job submitted to a ARC enabled
resource. The job can be referred to either by the jobid that was
returned by
.BR arcsub (1)
at submission time or by its jobname if the job description that was
submitted contained a jobname attribute.

More than one jobid and/or jobname can be given. If several jobs were
submitted with the same jobname the status of all those jobs are
shown. If the
.B --joblist
option is used the list of jobs is read from a file with the
specified filename. By specifying the
.B --all
option, the status of all active jobs will be shown.

By default
.B arcstat
presents job states as defined internally followed by middleware
specific representation of job state in brackets. The following
internal job states are defined:

.B Accepted
- job accepted on cluster but not being processed yet

.B Preparing
- job is in phase of preparing for submission to batch system

.B Submitting
- communication with batch system in ongoing

.B Hold
- job's processing is suspended dueto internal reason or user request

.B Queuing
- job is passed to batch system but not being executed yet

.B Running
- job being execcuted in batch system

.B Finishing
- job in phase of post-execution procedures being run

.B Finished
- job successfully completed all processing phases

.B Killed
- job processing was interrupted by user request

.B Failed
- job processing was interrupted due to detected failure

.B Deleted
- job was removed from cluster (usually because it stayed there too long)

.B Other
- middleware specific job state could not be adequately mappped to internal state

Those are also states which are used by
.BR arccat (1),
.BR arcclean (1),
.BR arcget (1),
.BR arckill (1),
.BR arcrenew (1),
.BR arcresume (1)
to perform job filtering.

If the
.B --long
option is given more detailed information is shown.

Jobs can be sorted according to the jobid, submissiontime or jobname, either
in normal or reverse order. By using the
.B --sort
or
.B --rsort
option
followed by the desired ordering ('jobid', 'submissiontime' or 'jobname'), jobs
will be sorted in normal or reverse order. Note that the options
.B --sort
and
.B --rsort
cannot be used at the same time.

The
.B --cluster
option can be used to select or reject jobs at specific clusters. See
.BR arcsub (1)
for a discussion of the format of arguments to this option. The
.B --status
option can be used to select jobs in a specific state. These options
can be repeated several times.

The
.B arcstat
command locates the available clusters by querying information index
servers. Which servers to query can be specified by giving the
.B --index
option to the command. See
.BR arcsub (1)
for a discussion of the format of arguments to this option.

Also in this case the
.B --long
option can be used to obtain more detailed information.

Previously the
.B arcstat
command was also used to query information of clusters and/or index servers.
This functionality have been moved to the new command
.B arcinfo
.

.SH FILES

.TP
.B ~/.arc/client.conf
Some options can be given default values by specifying them in the
ARC client configuration file. By using the
.B --conffile
option a different configuration file can be used than the default.

.TP
.B ~/.arc/jobs.xml
This a local list of the user's active jobs. When a job is
successfully submitted it is added to this list and when it is removed
from the remote cluster it is removed from this list. This list is
used as the list of all active jobs when the user specifies the
.B --all
option to the various NorduGrid ARC user interface commands. By using the
.B --joblist
option a different file can be used than the default.

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

.TP
.B X509_USER_PROXY
The location of the user's Grid proxy file. Shouldn't be set unless
the proxy is in a non-standard location.

.TP
.B ARC_LOCATION
The location where ARC is installed can be specified by this variable. If not
specified the install location will be determined from the path to the
command being executed, and if this fails a WARNING will be given stating the
location which will be used.

.TP
.B ARC_PLUGIN_PATH
The location of ARC plugins can be specified by this variable. Multiple
locations can be specified by separating them by : (; in Windows). The
default location is \fB$ARC_LOCATION\fR/lib/arc (\\ in Windows).

[NAME]
arcstat \- ARC Job Status

[EXTENDED DESCRIPTION]
The
.B arcstat
command gives the status of a job submitted to a ARC CE. 
The job can be referred to either by the jobid that was
returned by
.BR arcsub (1)
at submission time or by its jobname if the job description that was
submitted contained a jobname attribute.

More than one jobid and/or jobname can be given. If several jobs were
submitted with the same jobname the status of all those jobs are
shown. If the
.B --joblist
option is used the list of jobs is read from a file with the
specified filename. By specifying the
.B --all
option, the status of all active jobs will be shown.

By default
.B arcstat
presents job states as defined internally followed by middleware
specific representation of job state in brackets. The following
internal job states are defined:

.B Accepted
- job accepted on cluster but not being processed yet

.B Preparing
- job is in phase of preparing for submission to batch system

.B Submitting
- communication with batch system in ongoing

.B Hold
- job's processing is suspended dueto internal reason or user request

.B Queuing
- job is passed to batch system but not being executed yet

.B Running
- job being execcuted in batch system

.B Finishing
- job in phase of post-execution procedures being run

.B Finished
- job successfully completed all processing phases

.B Killed
- job processing was interrupted by user request

.B Failed
- job processing was interrupted due to detected failure

.B Deleted
- job was removed from cluster (usually because it stayed there too long)

.B Other
- middleware specific job state could not be adequately mappped to internal state

Those are also states which are used by
.BR arccat (1),
.BR arcclean (1),
.BR arcget (1),
.BR arckill (1),
.BR arcrenew (1),
.BR arcresume (1)
to perform job filtering.

If the
.B --long
option is given more detailed information is shown.

Jobs can be sorted according to the jobid, submissiontime or jobname, either
in normal or reverse order. By using the
.B --sort
or
.B --rsort
option
followed by the desired ordering ('jobid', 'submissiontime' or 'jobname'), jobs
will be sorted in normal or reverse order. Note that the options
.B --sort
and
.B --rsort
cannot be used at the same time.

The
.B --computing-element
option can be used to select or reject jobs at specific clusters. The
.B --status
option can be used to select jobs in a specific state. These options
can be repeated several times. See
.BR arcstat (1)
for possible state values.

Also in this case the
.B --long
option can be used to obtain more detailed information.

[FILES]
.TP
.B ~/.arc/client.conf
Some options can be given default values by specifying them in the
ARC client configuration file. By using the
.B --conffile
option a different configuration file can be used than the default.

.TP
.B ~/.arc/jobs.dat
This a local database of the user's active jobs. When a job is
successfully submitted it is added to database and when it is removed
from the remote CE it is removed from this list. This database is
used as the list of all active jobs when the user specifies the
.B --all
option to the various NorduGrid ARC user interface commands. By using the
.B --joblist
option a different file can be used than the default.

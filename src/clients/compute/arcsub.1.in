[NAME]
arcsub \- ARC Submission

[EXTENDED DESCRIPTION]
\fBarcsub\fR is the key command when submitting jobs to distributed computing
resources with the ARC client. 

Job submission can be accomplished by specifying a job description file to
submit as an argument. \fBarcsub\fR will then by default perform resource
discovery and then the discovered resources will be matched to the
job description and ranked according to the chosen broker (\fB--broker\fR
option). The brokers available can be
seen using
.B arcsub -P.

Please refer to ARC Documentation at http://www.nordugrid.org/arc for 
more information about job submission and management.

[EXAMPLES]
Submission of a job description file "helloworld.xrsl" to specified compute element:
.br
\fBarcsub -C ce.example.com helloworld.xrsl\fR

Submission of a job description file "helloworld.xrsl" to compute elements discovered
via the global NorduGrid registry:
.br
\fBarcsub -Y nordugrid.org helloworld.xrsl\fR

Direct submission to a CE without querying the information:
.br
\fBarcsub -Q NONE -T arcrest -C ce.example.com helloworld.xrsl\fR

[FILES]
.TP
.B ~/.arc/client.conf
Some options can be given default values by specifying them in the
ARC client configuration file. By using the
.B --conffile
option a different configuration file can be used than the default.

.TP
.B ~/.arc/jobs.dat
This a local database of the user's active jobs. When a job is
successfully submitted it is added to database and when it is removed
from the remote CE it is removed from this list. This database is
used as the list of all active jobs when the user specifies the
.B --all
option to the various NorduGrid ARC user interface commands. By using the
.B --joblist
option a different file can be used than the default.

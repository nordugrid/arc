.SH EXTENDED DESCRIPTION

\fBarcsub\fR is the key command when submitting jobs to Grid enabled computing
resources with the ARC client. As default \fBarcsub\fR is able to submit jobs to
A-REX, CREAM and EMI ES enabled computing elements (CEs), and as always for successful
submission you need to be authenticated at the targeted computing services. Since
\fBarcsub\fR is build on a modular library, modules can be installed which
enables submission to other targets, e.g. the classic ARC CE Grid-Manager.

Job submission can be accomplished by specifying a job description file to
submit as an argument. \fBarcsub\fR will then by default perform resource
discovery on the Grid and then the discovered resources will be matched to the
job description and ranked according to the chosen broker (\fB--broker\fR
option). If no Grid environment has been configured, please contact your system
administrator, or setup one yourself in the client configuration file (see files
section). Another option is to explicitly specify a registry service (or
multiple) to \fBarcsub\fR using the \fB--index\fR option, which accepts an URL,
alias or group.
Alternatively a specific CE (or multiple) can be targeted by using the
\fB--cluster\fR option. If such a scenario is the most common, it is worthwhile
to specify those CEs in the client configuration as default services, which
makes it superfluous to specify them as argument. In the same manner aliases and
groups, defined in the configuration file, can be utilized, and can be used as
argument to the \fB--cluster\fR or \fB--index\fR options.
In all of the above scenarios \fBarcsub\fR obtains resource information from the
services which is then used for matchmaking against the job description, however
that step can be avoided by specifying the \fB--direct\fR option, in which case
the job description is submitted directly to first specified endpoint.

The format of a classic GRIDFTP-based cluster URLs:
.br
\fB[ldap://]<hostname>[:2135/nordugrid-cluster-name=<hostname>,Mds-Vo-name=local,o=grid]\fR
.br
Only the \fBhostname\fR part has to be specified, the rest of the URL is automatically generated.

The format of an A-REX URL is:
.br
\fB[https://]<hostname>[:<port>][/<path>]\fR
.br
Here the port is 443 by default, but the path cannot be guessed, so if it is not specified, then
the service is assumed to live on the root path.

Job descriptions can also be specified using the \fB--jobdescrfile\fR option
which expect the file name of the description as argument, or the
\fB--jobdescrstring\fR option which expect as argument the job description as
a string, and both options can be specified multiple times and one does not
exclude the other. The default supported job description languages are xRSL
and EMIES ADL.

If the job description is successfully submitted a job-ID is returned and
printed. This job-ID uniquely identifies the job while it is being executed.
On the other hand it is also possible that no CEs matches the constraints
defined in the description in which case no submission will be done. Upon
successful submission, the job-ID along with more technical job information is
stored in the job-list file (described below). The stored information enables
the job management commands of the ARC client to manage jobs easily, and thus
the job-ID need not to be saved manually. By default the job-list file is
stored in the .arc directory in the home directory of the user, however another
location can be specified using the \fB--joblist\fR option taking the location
of this file as argument. If the \fB--joblist\fR option was used during
submission, it should also be specified in the consecutive commands when
managing the job. If a Computing Element has multiple job submission interfaces
(e.g. gridftp, EMI-ES, BES), then the brokering algorithm will choose one of them.
With the \fB--submissioninterface\fR option the requested interface
can be specified, and in that case only those Computing Elements will be
considered which has that specific interface, and only that interface
will be used to submit the jobs.

As mentioned above registry or index services can be specified with the
\fB--index\fR option. Specifying one or multiple index servers instructs the
\fBarcsub\fR command to query the servers for registered CEs, the returned CEs
will then be matched against the job description and those matching will be
ranked by the chosen broker (see below) and submission will be tried in order
until successful or reaching the end.
From the returned list of CEs it might happen that a troublesome or
undesirable CE is selected for submission, in that case it possible to reject
that cluster using the \fB--rejectdiscovery\fR option and providing the URL
(or just the hostname) of the CE, which will disregard that CE as a target for submission.

When multiple CEs are targeted for submission, the resource broker will be used
to filter out CEs which do not match the job description requirements and
then rank the remaining CEs. The broker used by default will rank the CEs
randomly, however a different broker can be chosen by using the
\fB--broker\fR option, which takes the name of the broker as argument. The
broker type can also be specified in client.conf. The brokers available can be
seen using
.B arcsub -P.
By default the following brokers are available:
.IP "Random (default)"
Chooses a random CE matching the job requirements. 
.IP "FastestQueue"
Ranks matching CEs according to the length of the job queue at the CEs, ranking
those with shortest queue first/highest.
.IP "Benchmark"
Ranks matching CEs according to a specified benchmark, which should be
specified by appending the broker name with ':' and then the name of the
benchmark. If no option is given to the Benchmark broker then CEs will be
ranked according to the 'specint2000' benchmark.
.IP "Data"
Ranks matching CEs according to the amount of input data cached by each CE, by 
querying the CE. Only CEs with the A-REX BES interface support this operation.
.IP "Null"
Choose a random CE with no filtering at all of CEs.
.IP "PythonBroker"
User-defined custom brokers can be created in Python. See the example broker
SampleBroker.py or ACIXBroker.py (like Data broker but uses the ARC Cache
Index) that come installed with ARC for more details of how to write your own
broker. A PythonBroker is specified by
\fB--broker PythonBroker:Filename.Class:args\fR, where Filename is the file
containing the class Class which implements the broker interface. The directory
containing this file must be in the PYTHONPATH. args is optional and allows
specifying arguments to the broker.
.P
Before submission, \fBarcsub\fR performs an intelligent modification of the job
description (adding or modifying attributes, even converting the description
language to fit the needs of the CE) ensuring that it is valid. The
modified job description can be printed by specifying the
\fB--dumpdescription\fR option. The format, i.e. job description language, of
the printed job description cannot be specified, and will be that which will
be sent to and accepted by the chosen target. Further information from
\fBarcsub\fR can be obtained by increasing the verbosity, which is done with
the \fB--debug\fR option where the default verbosity level is WARNING. Setting
the level to DEBUG will show all messages, while setting it to FATAL will
only show fatal log messages.

To \fBvalidate\fR your job description without actually submitting a job, use
the \fB--dryrun\fR option: it will capture possible syntax or other errors, but
will instruct the site not to submit the job for execution. Only the
grid-manager (ARC0) and A-REX (ARC1) CEs support this feature.

.SH EXAMPLES

Submission of a job description file "helloworld.adl" to the Grid
.br
\fBarcsub helloworld.adl\fR

A information index server (registry) can also be queried for CEs to submit to:
.br
\fBarcsub -g registry.example.com helloworld.adl\fR

Submission of a job description file "helloworld.adl" to ce.example.com:
.br
\fBarcsub -c ce.example.com helloworld.adl\fR

Direct submission to a CE is done as:
.br
\fBarcsub --direct -c cd.example.com helloworld.adl\fR

The job description can also be specified directly on the command line as shown
in the example, using the XRSL job description language:
.br
\fBarcsub -c example.com/arex -e \\
.br
\'&(executable="/bin/echo")(arguments="Hello World!")\'\fR

When submitting against CEs retrieved from information index servers it might
be useful to do resource brokering:
.br
\fBarcsub -g registry.example.com -b FastestQueue helloworld.adl\fR

If the job has a large input data set, it can be useful to send it to a CE
where those files are already cached. The ACIX broker can be used for this:
.br
\fBarcsub -g registry.example.com -b PythonBroker:ACIXBroker.ACIXBroker:https://cacheindex.ndgf.org:6443/data/index helloworld.adl\fR

Disregarding a specific CE for submission submitting against an information
index server:
.br
\fBarcsub -g registry.example.com -R badcomputingelement.com/arex helloworld.adl\fR

Dumping the job description is done as follows:
.br
\fBarcsub -c example.com/arex -x helloworld.adl\fR

.SH FILES

.TP
.B ~/.arc/client.conf
Some options can be given default values by specifying them in the ARC client
configuration file. Registry and computing element services can be specified
in separate sections of the config. The default services can be specified by
adding 'default=yes' attribute to the section of the service,
thus when no \fB--cluster\fR or \fB--index\fR
options are given these will be used for submission. Each service has an alias,
and can be member of any number of groups. Then specifying the alias or the
name of the group with the \fB--cluster\fR or \fB--index\fR options will
select the given services.
By using the \fB--conffile\fR option a different configuration file can be used
than the default. Note that some installations also have a system client
configuration file, however attributes in the client one takes precedence,
and then command line options takes precedence over configuration file
attributes.

.TP
.B ~/.arc/jobs.xml
This a local list of the user's active jobs. When a job is successfully
submitted it is added to this list and when it is removed from the remote
cluster it is removed from this list. This list is used as the list of all
active jobs when the user specifies the \fB--all\fR option to the various
NorduGrid ARC user interface commands. By using the \fB--joblist\fR option a
different file can be used than the default.

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

.TP
.B X509_USER_PROXY
The location of the user's Grid proxy file. Shouldn't be set unless
the proxy is in a non-standard location.

.TP
.B ARC_LOCATION
The location where ARC is installed can be specified by this variable. If not
specified the install location will be determined from the path to the
command being executed, and if this fails a WARNING will be given stating the
location which will be used.

.TP
.B ARC_PLUGIN_PATH
The location of ARC plugins can be specified by this variable. Multiple
locations can be specified by separating them by : (; in Windows). The
default location is \fB$ARC_LOCATION\fR/lib/arc (\\ in Windows).

.SH EXTENDED DESCRIPTION

The ARC user interface keeps a local list of active jobs in the users 
home directory (see \fBarcsub\fR(1)). If this file is lost, or the user 
wants to recreate the file on a different computer,the \fBarcsync\fR 
command can be used to recreate the file from the information available 
the specified cluster or index server.

Since the information about a job retrieved from a clsuter can be 
slightly out of date if the user very recently submitted or removed a 
job a warning is issued when this command is run. The \fB-force\fR 
option disables this warning.

The 
.B --cluster
options can be used to select or reject clusters that should be 
considered in the synchronization. This options can be repeated several 
times.  See
.BR arcsub (1)
for a discussion of the format of arguments to this option.

If a specific cluster is selected for the syncronisation while the joblist 
contains jobs on a different cluster, running the arcsync command will 
remove the old jobs from the joblist, unless the
.B --merge
option is given, in which case the new found jobs are merge with the 
jobs already in the joblist.

.SH FILES

.TP
.B ~/.arc/client.xml
Some options can be given default values by specifying them in the
ARC client configuration file. By using the
.B --conffile
option a different configuration file can be used than the default.

.TP
.B ~/.arc/jobs.xml
This a local list of the user's active jobs. When a job is
successfully submitted it is added to this list and when it is removed
from the remote cluster it is removed from this list. This list is
used as the list of all active jobs when the user specifies the
.B --all
option to the various NorduGrid ARC user interface commands. By using the
.B --joblist
option a different file can be used than the default.

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

.TP
.B X509_USER_PROXY
The location of the user's grid proxy file. Shouldn't be set unless
the proxy is in a non-standard location.

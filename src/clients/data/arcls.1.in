[NAME]
arcls \- list files or directories

[EXTENDED DESCRIPTION]
The
.B arcls
command lists files and directories on grid storage elements and in
file index catalogues. Depending on the installed libraries (check with
.B -P
), the following protocols may be used: file  (file://  prefix  may  be
omitted), http, https, httpg, ftp, gsiftp, srm, root.
 
In the case of a directory/fileset, attributes of objects belonging
to it will be retrieved, unless
.B --nolist
is specified.

If url starts from '@', the remainder should be a path to a local file
containing list of URLs, one per line. Then arcls acts as if it was
called multiple times, once for each URL. For more information on ARC
URL syntax please read "Protocols, Uniform Resource Locators (URL) and
Extensions Supported in ARC" [NORDUGRID-TECH-7]

option a different configuration file can be used than the default.

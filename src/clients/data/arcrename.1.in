[NAME]
arcrename \- rename file or directory

[EXTENDED DESCRIPTION]
The
.B arcrename
command renames files or directories on grid storage elements and indexing
services. The path component of
.B oldurl
and
.B newurl
must differ and it must be the only component of both URLs which is different.
.B arcrename
will exit with an error if the paths are equivalent or other components of
the URLs are different. Renaming a URL to an existing URL will either fail
or overwrite the existing URL, depending on the protocol. 
.B arcrename
works purely at the namespace level and does not perform data transfer.

For more information on ARC URL syntax please read "Protocols, Uniform
Resource Locators (URL) and Extensions Supported in ARC" [NORDUGRID-TECH-7]

Depending on the installed libraries (check with
.B -P
), the following protocols may be used: file  (file://  prefix  may  be
omitted), http, https, httpg, ftp, gsiftp, srm, root. However
renaming is not supported or implemented for some of those protocols.

[FILES]

option a different configuration file can be used than the default.

location which will be used.

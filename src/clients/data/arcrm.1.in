[NAME]
arcrm \- delete files

[EXTENDED DESCRIPTION]
The
.B arcrm
command deletes files on grid storage elements and indexing services.
In the case of an indexing service url all physical instances of 
the file corresponding to the given locations are deleted and
unregistered. If an indexing service url is given without locations, 
all physical instances and all meta-information about file are deleted.
For more information on ARC URL syntax please read "Protocols, Uniform
Resource Locators (URL) and Extensions Supported in ARC" [NORDUGRID-TECH-7]

If
.B url
starts from '@', the remaining argument is assumed to be a
path to a local file containing a list of URLs, one per line.
In this case
.B arcrm
performs like it were called with all those URLs as arguments.

Depending on the installed libraries (check with
.B -P
), the following protocols may be used: file  (file://  prefix  may  be
omitted), http, https, httpg, ftp, gsiftp, srm, root.

.B ~/.arc/client.conf
Some options can be given default values by specifying them in the

.B --conffile
option a different configuration file can be used than the default.

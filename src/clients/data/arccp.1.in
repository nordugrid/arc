[NAME]
arccp \- copy files

[EXTENDED DESCRIPTION]
The
.B arccp
command copies files to, from and between grid storage elements. It can
also be used to register files in file index catalogues, either
automatically as the result of a file transfer, or by using the
.B --notransfer
option. For more information on ARC URL syntax please read "Protocols, Uniform
Resource Locators (URL) and Extensions Supported in ARC" [NORDUGRID-TECH-7].

If
.B source
and/or
.B destination
start from '@', the remaining argument is assumed to be a
path to a local file containing a list of URLs, one per line.
In this case
.B arccp
performs like it were called multiple times - once for every URL.

When copying directories both the source and destination must end with the
directory separator character and a recursion option
.B -r
or
.B -D
must be specified.

All data transfer goes through the machine of the caller of arccp, even in the
case of two remote endpoints, unless the
.B --thirdparty
option is used. With this option credentials are delegated to the destination
and it pulls the data directly from the source. The timeout option in this case
applies to the entire transfer itself and default timeouts are used for
connections to the remote endpoints. Note that third-party transfer is only
possible if the GFAL2 plugin is installed.

Depending on the installed libraries (check with
.B -P
), the following protocols may be used: file  (file://  prefix  may  be
omitted), http, https, httpg, ftp, gsiftp, srm, root. To connect 
source or destination to standard input/output use '-' instead of URL.

[FILES]
.TP
.B ~/.arc/client.conf
Some options can be given default values by specifying them in the
ARC client configuration file. By using the
.B --conffile
option a different configuration file can be used than the default.

[ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES]
.TP
.B X509_USER_PROXY
The location of the user's Grid proxy file. Shouldn't be set unless
the proxy is in a non-standard location.

.TP
.B ARC_LOCATION
The location where ARC is installed can be specified by this variable. If not
specified the install location will be determined from the path to the
command being executed, and if this fails a WARNING will be given stating the
location which will be used.

.TP
.B ARC_PLUGIN_PATH
The location of ARC plugins can be specified by this variable. Multiple
locations can be specified by separating them by : (; in Windows). The
default location is \fB$ARC_LOCATION\fR/lib/arc (\\ in Windows).

[EXAMPLE]
arccp -i gsiftp://example.com/grid/file1.dat /tmp/file1.dat

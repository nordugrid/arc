  /**
   * This class provides a container for a selection of various
   * attributes/parameters which can be configured to needs of the user,
   * and can be read by implementing instances or programs. The class
   * can be used in two ways. One can create a object from a
   * configuration file, or simply set the desired attributes by using
   * the setter method, associated with every setable attribute. The
   * list of attributes which can be configured in this class are:
   * - certificatepath / CertificatePath(const std::string&)
   * - keypath / KeyPath(const std::string&)
   * - proxypath / ProxyPath(const std::string&)
   * - cacertificatesdirectory / CACertificatesDirectory(const std::string&)
   * - cacertificatepath / CACertificatePath(const std::string&)
   * - timeout / Timeout(int)
   * - joblist / JobListFile(const std::string&)
   * - joblisttype / JobListType(const std::string&)
   * - verbosity / Verbosity(const std::string&)
   * - brokername / Broker(const std::string&) or Broker(const std::string&, const std::string&)
   * - brokerarguments / Broker(const std::string&) or Broker(const std::string&, const std::string&)
   * - vomsserverpath / VOMSESPath(const std::string&)
   * - username / UserName(const std::string&)
   * - password / Password(const std::string&)
   * - keypassword / KeyPassword(const std::string&)
   * - keysize / KeySize(int)
   * - certificatelifetime / CertificateLifeTime(const Period&)
   * - slcs / SLCS(const URL&)
   * - storedirectory / StoreDirectory(const std::string&)
   * - jobdownloaddirectory / JobDownloadDirectory(const std::string&)
   * - idpname / IdPName(const std::string&)
   * - submissioninterface / SubmissionInterface(const std::string&)
   * - infointerface / InfoInterface(const std::string&)
   *
   * where the first term is the name of the attribute used in the
   * configuration file, and the second term is the associated setter
   * method (for more information about a given attribute see the
   * description of the setter method).
   *
   * The configuration file should have a INI-style format and the
   * IniConfig class will thus be used to parse the file. The above
   * mentioned attributes should be placed in the common section.
   *
   * Besides the options above, the configuration file can contain
   * information about services (service registries and computing elements).
   * Each service has to be put in its on section. Each service has
   * an alias, which is a short name. The name of the section consists
   * of the word `registry` for service registries and `computing` for
   * computing elements, then contains a slash and the alias of the
   * service. e.g. `[registry/index1]` or `[computing/testce]`
   * In a service section the possible options are the following:
   *  - url: is the url of the service
   *  - default: if yes, then this service will be used if no other is specified
   *  - group: assigns the service to a group with a given name
   * 
   * For computing elements the following additional options exist:
   *  - infointerface: the GLUE2 InterfaceName of the local information system
   *  - submissioninterface: the GLUE2 InterfaceName to the job submission interface
   *
   * For a service registry the following additional option exist:
   *  - registryinterface: the GLUE2 InterfaceName of the service registry interface
   *
   * These services can be accessed by the #GetService, #GetServices,
   * #GetDefaultServices, #GetServicesInGroup methods, which return ConfigEndpoint
   * object(s). The ConfigEndpoint objects contain the URL and the InterfaceNames
   * of the services.
   *
   * The UserConfig class also provides a method InitializeCredentials()
   * for locating user credentials by searching in different standard
   * locations. The CredentialsFound() method can be used to test if
   * locating the credentials succeeded.

     *   are tried.  If found no more proxy paths are tried.
     * - Current proxy path as passed to the contructor, explicitly set
     *   using the setter method ProxyPath(const std::string&) or read
     *   from configuration by constructor or LoadConfiguartionFile()
     *   method. If value is set and corresponding file does not exist
     *   it considered to be an error and no other locations are tried.
     *   If found no more proxy paths are tried.
     * - Proxy path made of x509up_u token concatenated with the user
     *   numerical ID located in the OS temporary directory. It is NOT
     *   an error if corresponding file does not exist and processing
     *   continues.
     * - Key/certificate paths specified by the environment variables
     *   X509_USER_KEY and X509_USER_CERT. If values  are set and
     *   corresponding files do not exist it considered to be an error
     *   and no other locations are tried. Error message is suppressed
     *   if proxy was previously found.
     * - Current key/certificate paths passed to the contructor or
     *   explicitly set using the setter methods KeyPath(const std::string&)
     *   and CertificatePath(const std::string&) or read from configuration
     *   by constructor or LoadConfiguartionFile() method. If values
     *   are set and corresponding files do not exist it is an error
     *   and no other locations are tried. Error message is suppressed
     *   if proxy was previously found.
     * - Key/certificate paths ~/.arc/usercert.pem and ~/.arc/userkey.pem
     *   respectively are tried. It is not an error if not found.
     * - Key/certificate paths ~/.globus/usercert.pem and ~/.globus/userkey.pem
     *   respectively are tried. It is not an error if not found.
     * - Key/certificate paths created by concatenation of ARC installation
     *   location and /etc/arc/usercert.pem and /etc/arc/userkey.pem
     *   respectively are tried. It is not an error if not found.
     * - Key/certificate located in current working directory are tried.
     * - If neither proxy nor key/certificate files are found this is
     *   considered to be an error.
     *
     * Along with the proxy and key/certificate pair, the path of the
     * directory containing CA certificates is also located. The presence
     * of directory will be checked in the following order and first
     * found is accepted:
     * - Path specified by the X509_CERT_DIR environment variable.
     *   It is an error if value is set and directory does not exist.
     * - Current path explicitly specified by using the setter method
     *   CACertificatesDirectory() or read from configuration by
     *   constructor or LoadConfiguartionFile() method. It is an error
     *   if value is set and directory does not exist.
     * - Path ~/.globus/certificates. It is not an error if it does
     *   not exist.
     * - Path created by concatenating the ARC installation location
     *   and /etc/certificates. It is not an error if it does not exist.
     * - Path created by concatenating the ARC installation location
     *   and /share/certificates. It is not an error if it does not exist.
     * - Path /etc/grid-security/certificates.
     *
     * It is an error if none of the directories above exist.
     *
     * In case of initializeCredentials == TryCredentials method behaves
     * same way like in case RequireCredentials except it does not report
     * errors through its Logger object and does not return false.
     *
     * If NotTryCredentials is used method does not check for presence of
     * credentials. It behaves like if corresponding files are always
     * present.
     *
     * And in case of SkipCredentials method does nothing.
     *

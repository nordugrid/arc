     Every Logger (except for the rootLogger) has a parent Logger. The
     domain of a Logger (a string that indicates the origin of
     LogMessages) is composed by adding a subdomain to the domain of
     its parent Logger.

     A Logger also has a threshold. Every LogMessage that have a level
     that is greater than or equal to the threshold is forwarded to any
     LogDestination connected to this Logger as well as to the parent
     Logger.

     Typical usage of the Logger class is to declare a global Logger
     object for each library/module/component to be used by all classes
     and methods there.

     Logger messages may be localised according to the current locale. Some
     locales are better supported than others.

     Example code for setting up logger in main():
     @code
  // Set up stderr as a log stream
  Arc::LogStream logcerr(std::cerr);
  // Log message is prefixed by level only
  logcerr.setFormat(Arc::ShortFormat);
  // Add the stderr destination to the root logger
  Arc::Logger::getRootLogger().addDestination(logcerr);
  // Set the logging threshold to WARNING
  Arc::Logger::getRootLogger().setThreshold(Arc::WARNING);

  // Logger to use in main() - it inherits all properties from the root Logger
  Arc::Logger logger(Arc::Logger::getRootLogger(), "main");
  // this message will not be logged since it is below the threshold
  logger.msg(Arc::INFO, "main started");
  int i = 5;
  // This message will be logged

/**
 * \defgroup data ARC data library (libarcdata)
 *
 * libarcdata is a library for access to data on the Grid. It provides a
 * uniform interface to several types of Grid storage and catalogs using
 * various protocols. The protocols usable on a given system depend on the
 * packages installed. The interface can be used to read, write, list, transfer
 * and delete data to and from storage systems and catalogs.
 *
 * The library uses ARC's dynamic plugin mechanism to load plugins for
 * specific protocols only when required at runtime. These plugins are
 * called Data Manager Components (DMCs). The DataHandle class takes care of
 * automatically loading the required DMC at runtime to create a DataPoint object
 * representing a resource accessible through a given protocol. DataHandle
 * should always be used instead of DataPoint directly.
 *
 * To create a new DMC for a protocol which is not yet supported see the
 * instruction and examples in the DataPoint class documentation. This
 * documentation also gives a complete overview of the interface.
 *
 * The following protocols are currently supported in standard distributions
 * of ARC.
 *
 * - File (%file://) - Regular local file system.
 *
 * - GridFTP (gsiftp://) - GridFTP is essentially the FTP protocol with GSI
 * security. Regular FTP can also be used.
 *
 * - HTTP(S/G) (%http://) - Hypertext Transfer Protocol. HTTP over SSL (HTTPS)
 * and HTTP over GSI (HTTPG) are also supported.
 *
 * - LDAP (ldap://) - Lightweight Directory Access Protocol. LDAP is used in
 * grids mainly to store information about grid services or resources rather
 * than to store data itself.
 *
 * - SRM (srm://) - The Storage Resource Manager (SRM) protocol allows access
 * to data distributed across physical storage through a unified namespace
 * and management interface.
 *
 * - XRootd (root://) - Protocol for data access across large scale storage
 * clusters. More information can be found at http://xrootd.slac.stanford.edu/
 *
 * - ACIX (acix://) - The ARC Cache Index contains locations of cached files
 * in ARC CE caches.
 *
 * DataMover provides a simple high-level interface to copy files. Fine-grained
 * control over data transfer is shown in the following example:
 *
 * \include partial_copy.cpp
 *
 * And the same example in python
 *
 * \include partial_copy.py

  /// A DataPoint represents a data resource and is an abstraction of a URL.
  /**
   * DataPoint uses ARC's Plugin mechanism to dynamically load the required
   * Data Manager Component (DMC) when necessary. A DMC typically defines a
   * subclass of DataPoint (e.g. DataPointHTTP) and is responsible for a
   * specific protocol (e.g. http). DataPoints should not be used directly,
   * instead the DataHandle wrapper class should be used, which automatically
   * loads the correct DMC. Examples of how to use DataPoint methods are shown
   * in the DataHandle documentation.
   *
   * DataPoint defines methods for access to the data resource. To transfer
   * data between two DataPoints, DataMover::Transfer() can be used.
   *
   * There are two subclasses of DataPoint, DataPointDirect and DataPointIndex.
   * None of these three classes can be instantiated directly.
   * DataPointDirect and its subclasses handle "physical" resources through
   * protocols such as file, http and gsiftp. These classes implement methods
   * such as StartReading() and StartWriting(). DataPointIndex and its
   * subclasses handle resources such as indexes and catalogs and implement
   * methods like Resolve() and PreRegister().
   *
   * When creating a new DMC, a subclass of either DataPointDirect or
   * DataPointIndex should be created, and the appropriate methods implemented.
   * DataPoint itself has no direct external dependencies, but plugins may
   * rely on third-party components. The new DMC must also add itself to the
   * list of available plugins and provide an Instance() method which returns
   * a new instance of itself, if the supplied arguments are valid for the
   * protocol. Here is an example skeleton implementation of a new DMC for
   * protocol MyProtocol which represents a physical resource accessible through
   * protocol my://
   * \include DataPointMyProtocol.cpp

///Class for manipulating SAML Token Profile.
/**This class is for generating/consuming SAML Token profile.
 * See WS-Security SAML Token Profile v1.1 (www.oasis-open.org/committees/wss)
 * Currently this class is used by samltoken handler (will appears in src/hed/pdc/samltokensh/)
 * It is not a must to directly called this class. If we need to
 * use SAML Token functionality, we only need to configure the samltoken
 * handler into service and client.
 * Currently, only a minor part of the specification has been implemented.
 * 
 * About how to identify and reference security token for signing message,
 * currently, only the "SAML Assertion Referenced from KeyInfo" (part 3.4.2 of 
 * WS-Security SAML Token Profile v1.1 specification) is supported, which means
 * the implementation can only process SAML assertion "referenced from KeyInfo",
 * and also can only generate SAML Token with SAML assertion "referenced from KeyInfo".
 * More complete support need to implement.
 * 
 * About subject confirmation method, the implementation can process "hold-of-key"
 * (part 3.5.1 of WS-Security SAML Token Profile v1.1 specification) subject 
 * subject confirmation method.
 * 
 * About SAML vertion, the implementation can process SAML assertion with SAML 
 * version 1.1 and 2.0; can only generate SAML assertion with SAML vertion 2.0.
 *
 * In the SAML Token profile, for the hold-of-key subject confirmation method, 
 * there are three interaction parts: the attesting entity, the relying party
 * and the issuing authority. In the hold-of-key subject confirmation method, 
 * it is the attesting entity's subject identity which will be inserted into 
 * the SAML assertion.
 *
 * Firstly the attesting entity authenticates to issuing authority by using some 
 * authentication scheme such as WSS x509 Token profile (Alterbatively the 
 * usename/password authentication scheme or other different authentication scheme 
 * can also be used, unless the issuing authority can retrive the key from a 
 * trusted certificate server after firmly establishing the subject's identity 
 * under the username/password scheme). So then issuing authority is able to 
 * make a definitive statement (sign a SAML assertion) about an act of 
 * authentication that has already taken place. 
 *
 * The attesting entity gets the SAML assertion and then signs the soap message together
 * with the assertion by using its private key (the relevant certificate has been authenticated
 * by issuing authority, and its relevant public key has been put into SubjectConfirmation
 * element under saml assertion by issuing authority. Only the actual owner of the 
 * saml assertion can do this, as only the subject possesses the private key paired 
 * with the public key in the assertion. This establishes an irrefutable connection 
 * between the author of the SOAP message and the assertion describing an authentication event.)
 *
 * The relying party is supposed to trust the issuing authority. When it receives a message
 * from the asserting entity, it will check the saml assertion based on its 
 * predetermined trust relationship with the SAML issuing authority, and check
 * the signature of the soap message based on the public key in the saml assertion
 * without directly trust relationship with attesting entity (subject owner).

  /**
   * \defgroup compute ARC Compute Library (libarccompute)
   * 
   * libarccompute is a library for discovering, quering, matching and ranking,
   * submitting jobs to and managing jobs on Grid resources, as well as parsing
   * and assembling job descriptions. It features a uniform high-level interface
   * to a wide range of Service Registries, Information Systems and Computing
   * Services. With this interface, registries can be queried for service
   * endpoints, information systems can be queried for detailed resource and job
   * information, and jobs can be submitted to and managed in a Grid
   * environment. The library doesn't offer specific interfaces to different
   * services, instead it tries to provide a uniform interface to different kind
   * of services.
   * 
   * An introduction on how to use the library to query services for information
   * is given in the description of the EntityRetriever class. How to use the
   * library for submitting jobs is described at the Submitter class reference
   * page. How to manage jobs with the library is described at the JobSupervisor
   * class reference page.
   * 
   * The library uses ARC's dynamic plugin mechanism to load plugins for
   * specific services and features only when required at runtime. These plugins
   * for the libarccompute library are called ARC Compute Components (ACCs).
   * Each of the classes listed below will transparently load any required ACC
   * plugins at runtime when needed. If preferred ACC plugins can also be used
   * and loaded manually, which is described in more detail \ref accplugins
   * "here".
   * 
   * Support for a custom service (info-system, registry or compute), a ranking
   * algorithm and/or a job description parsing/assembling algorithm is exactly
   * what is defined as a ACC, and it can easily be added to be accessible to
   * the libarccompute library. More details about creating such a plugin can be
   * found \ref accplugins "here".
   * 
   * With the default NorduGrid ARC plugins installed the librarccompute library
   * supports the following services and specifications:
   * 
   * <b>Computing Services:</b>
   * * EMI ES
   * * GridFTPJob interface (requires the nordugrid-arc-plugins-globus package)
   * 
   * <b>Registry and Index Services:</b>

  /// Class for submitting jobs.
  /**
   * As the name indicates this class is used for submitting jobs. It has a
   * number of different submit methods which can be used directly for different
   * job submission purposes. The class it self can be considered as a frontend 
   * to the SubmitterPlugin class, an abstract class which is extended by
   * specialised plugins providing the actual coupling to a particular type of
   * computing service. As a frontend, this class also takes care of loading
   * the specialised plugins and choosing the right plugin for a given computing
   * service, however that can also be done manually with the
   * SubmitterPluginLoader class. In order to use the Submitter class a
   * reference to a UserConfig object must be provided, it should exist
   * throughout the lifetime of the created Submitter object, and the UserConfig
   * object should contain configuration details such as the path to user
   * credentials.
   * 
   * Generally there are two types of submit methods. One which doesn't
   * accept a reference to a Job or list of Job objects, and one which does.
   * This is because the Submitter class is able to pass submitted Job objects
   * to consumer objects. Registering a consumer object is done using the
   * \ref Submitter::addConsumer "addConsumer" method passing a reference to an
   * EntityConsumer<Job> object. An
   * example of such a consumer is the JobSupervisor class. Multiple consumers
   * can be registered for the same Submitter object. Every submit method will
   * then pass submitted Job objects to the registered consumer objects. A
   * registered consumer can be removed using the
   * \ref Submitter::removeConsumer "removeConsumer" method.
   * 
   * For submitting a Grid job one should use one of the
   * \ref Submitter::BrokeredSubmit "BrokeredSubmit" methods. They accept a list 
   * of job descriptions and a list of information system endpoints for which
   * computing services are discovered and matched to the job descriptions.
   * Jobs are then submitted to the matching services in the order ranked by the
   * \ref Broker "algorithm" specified in the UserConfig object.
   * 
   * Another way of submitting a job is by using the
   * \ref Submitter::Submit "Submit" methods. These methods accepts submission
   * endpoints or ExecutionTarget objects. Using these methods will not do
   * any client side checks whether the computing service resources pointed to
   * by the submission endpoint (or ExecutionTarget) really matches the
   * specified job description(s).
   * 
   * Common for both ways of submitting jobs is that they both return a
   * SubmissionStatus object indicating the outcome of the submission attemp(s).
   * If the returned status object indicates failures, further examination can
   * be carried out by using the
   * \ref Submitter::GetDescriptionsNotSubmitted "GetDescriptionsNotSubmitted",
   * \ref Submitter::GetEndpointQueryingStatuses "GetEndpointQueryingStatuses"
   * and/or \ref Submitter::GetEndpointSubmissionStatuses "GetEndpointSubmissionStatuses"
   * methods. Note that on each invocation of any of the submit methods the
   * state from a previous submission attemp will be cleared, thus the just
   * mentioned methods should be used just after an attempted submission fails.
   * 
   * An example of submitting a Grid job using C++ is shown below:
   * \include basic_job_submission.cpp
   * This code can be compiled with
   * \code
   * g++ -o submit -I/usr/include/libxml2 `pkg-config --cflags glibmm-2.4` -l arccompute submit.cpp
   * \endcode

   * Same example using Python shown below:
   * \include basic_job_submission.py

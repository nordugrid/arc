Folder for ARC Client Components (ACC)

ACCs are the plugins used by the client to interface to different 
grid flavours and to perform resource brokering. One folder exists 
for each supported grid flavour and one folder for specialized brokers.
Each flavour should implement specialized classes of the 
following base classes (located in src/hed/libs/compute)


The plugins are loaded by appropriate "umbrella" classes such 
as the JobSupervisor and TargetGenerator which resolves issues
about which plugins (i.e flavour) to load depending on the 
command in question. Specialized brokers are being loaded by the 
submission executable directly.

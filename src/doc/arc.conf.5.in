.TH arc.conf 5 "@DATE@" "NorduGrid ARC @VERSION@" "NorduGrid ARC"

.SH NAME
arc.conf \- ARC services configuration

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
ARC has two separate configuration files - one for client tools and
another for services. This man page describes the services configuration file.
For client configuration please see "ARC Clients User Manual" at
http://www.nordugrid.org/documents/arc-ui.pdf
.PP
This man page IS NOT the ultimate source of information about \fBarc.conf\fR.
The reference documentation containing all configuration option description is 
\fBarc.conf.reference\fR file that can be found in \fB@pkgdatadir@/examples\fR.
.PP
To get inline help about particular configuration option use \fBarcctl (1)\fR
tool.
.PP
For example to get description of \fBsessiondir\fR option in \fB[arex]\fR block run
.IP
\f(CW# arcctl config describe arex sessiondir\fR
.PP

.SH BASIC STRUCTURE
.PP
A block configures an ARC service, a service interface, a utility or a subsystem.
Enabling (turning on) a functionality, a service or an interface requires the presence of the
appropriate configuration block. To disable a service or an interface, simply delete or
comment out the related arc.conf block (you may need to rerun the corresponding startup script).
.PP
A block is identified by its block header. A block header may consist of
keywords and optionally block identifiers. Keywords may be separated by "/" 
and used to label subblocks (e.g. \fI[arex/jura]\fR), while block identifiers
are separated by ":" from keywords. 
.PP
For example, in the \fI[queue:short]\fR block header \fIqueue\fR is a keyword while \fIshort\fR is an 
identifier, e.g. the name of the queue. Block headers must be UNIQUE.
.PP
A block starts with a unique \fI[keyword:identifier]\fR blockheader and ends where the next block
starts, that is at the next \fI[blockheader]\fR directive. 
.PP
A block may have sub-blocks e.g. the various interfaces of the AREX service are configured via
sub-blocks (e.g. \fI[arex/ws]\fR). When a sub-block is enabled then the corresponding parent block MUST
also appear in the arc.conf file.
.PP
Configuration blocks contain (config option, config value) pairs following the syntax:
.I config_option=value element [optional value element] 
in single line. 
.PP
Each of the configuration options have well-defined default that is specified in this reference
file. The default can take either a pre-set value, a special substitution or the keyword
\fIundefined\fR. Configuration options within an enabled block take their default values in case 
they are missing (or commented out). Configuration parameters with undefined defaults takes 
no values. Furthermore, configuration options within disabled blocks takes no values either.
.PP
Configuration blocks related to authorization are ORDER-DEPENDENT! The authorization blocks 
\fI[authgroup:name]\fR MUST be defined before used in the other blocks. 
Furthermore, the order of the authorization blocks itself may have influence over 
authorization decisions!
.PP
Note that quotes around the configuration value(s) must NOT be used any longer.
.PP
Note that the arc.conf is CASE-SENSITIVE!

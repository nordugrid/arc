##
## Configuration blocks and variables for the ARC services via the arc.conf.
##
## NEVER USE THIS DOCUMENT AS A CONFIGURATION FILE!
## There are out-of-the-box minimal configuration templates provided
## for all services.
##
## The arc.conf configuration file consists of blocks like
## [common], [grid-manager], [gridftpd], [gridftpd/name], [group],
## [data-staging], [nordugridmap], [vo], [cluster], [queue/name],
## [infosys], [infosys/index/name], [infosys/index/name/registration/name].
##
## A block is identified by its blockname. A blockname consists of
## keywords and optionally block identifiers: [gridftpd/jobs] here 'gridftpd' is
## a keyword while 'jobs' is an identifier. Block names must be UNIQUE ([vo] is
## the only exception). A block starts with a unique [blockname] and ends with
## the next [blockname] directive. Currently the following keywords are used in
## the block names: common, grid-manager, gridftpd, group, data-staging,
## nordugridmap, vo, infosys, registration, cluster, queue, logger, acix
##
## Some parts of the configuration file are order-dependent, blocks may require
## other blocks be defined earlier (especially the authorization blocks).
##
## The arc.conf configures all the ARC services, and enabling an ARC service on
## a resource requires the presence of the appropriate configuration blocks.
## The ARC services are the following: gridftpd, A-REX (grid-manager block),
## infosys, infosys registration. The nordugridmap utility is also configured by
## the [nordugridmap] and [vo] block(s) of this file.
##
## For example, to connect a computing cluster to the grid and for it to
## accept grid jobs you should have at least the [common], [grid-manager],
## [infosys], [cluster], [queue/queue_name], [infosys/cluster/registration/name]
## blocks configured. For classic setup with GridFTP interface [gridftpd] and
## [gridftpd/jobs] section are also necessary.
##
## As another example we give the necessary blocks for an Index Service:
## [infosys], [infosys/index/name], [infosys/index/name/registration/name]
##
## Configuration blocks contain (variable, variable value) pairs following the
## syntax: variable="the variable value comes in quotes".
## The quotes around the variable value are a MUST!
## Note that the variable names are CASE-SENSITIVE!
## Unset configuration options (variables) take the default values.
##
## Below we give a detailed description of all the configuration options of the
## different configuration blocks.
##
## WARNING: this file will not work as a configuration template!
##
## Developers: This file is parsed by configuration validation scripts and so
##   it is important that it follows the correct syntax. For each block or
##   option please add explanatory text with two ## and a space at the
##   beginning of the line and then an example with a single # and no spaces at
##   the beginning of the line.

#####################################################################



### The [common] block ##############################################
## The parameters set within this block are available for all the other blocks.
## These are the config parameters shared by the different components of ARC
## (e.g. grid-manager, infosys)
#[common]

## hostname - the FQDN of the frontend node, optional in the common block but
## MUST be set in the cluster block
#hostname="myhost.org"

## x509_voms_dir path - the path to the directory containing *.lsc files
## needed for checking validity of VOMS extensions.  If not specified default
## value /etc/grid-security/vomsdir is used.
#x509_voms_dir="/etc/grid-security/vomsdir"

### LRMS
## ARC supports various LRMS flavours, as listed in this section. For detailed
## description of options please refer to ARC CE sysadmin guide:
##  http://www.nordugrid.org/documents/arc-ce-sysadm-guide.pdf
## ONLY ONE LRMS IS ALLOWED. MULTIPLE lrms ENTRIES WILL TRIGGER UNEXPECTED
## BEHAVIOUR.
##
## lrms sets the type of the Local Resource Management System (queue system),
## and optionally - the default queue name, separated with a blank space:
## "lrmstype queue_name". For lrmstype, the following systems are supported
## and can be chosen (one per server):
##    fork   - simple forking of jobs to the same node as the server
##    sge    - (Sun/Oracle) Grid Engine
##    condor - Condor
##    pbs    - PBS
##    lsf    - LSF
##    ll     - LoadLeveler
##    slurm  - SLURM
##    boinc  - Boinc
## PBS has many flavours, ARC currenly supports OpenPBS, PBSPro, ScalablePBS
## and Torque (the official name for ScalablePBS). There is no need to specify
## the flavour or the version number of the PBS, simply write 'pbs'. Similarly,
## there is no need to specify (Sun/Oracle) Grid Engine versions and flavours.
## "lrmstype" MUST be set here, it is a MANDATORY parameter!
## The optional "queue" parameter specifies the default Grid queue of the
## LRMS. Jobs will be submitted to this queue if they do not specify queue
## name in job description. Queue name must match one of the [queue/queue_name]
## block labels, see below.
##

### PBS
#lrms="pbs gridlong"
#lrms="pbs"

## the path to the qstat,pbsnodes,qmgr etc PBS binaries,
## no need to set if PBS is not used
#pbs_bin_path="/usr/bin"

## the path of the PBS server logfiles which are used by A-REX to determine
## whether a PBS job is completed. If not specified, A-REX will use qstat for that.
#pbs_log_path="/var/spool/pbs/server_logs"


### Condor
#lrms="condor"

## condor_rank - If you are not happy with the way Condor picks nodes when
## running jobs, you can define your own ranking algorithm by optionally
## setting the condor_rank attribute. condor_rank should be set to a
## ClassAd float expression that you could use in the Rank attribute
## in a Condor job description.
## Obviously no need to set if Condor is not used. An example:
#condor_rank="(1-LoadAvg/2)*(1-LoadAvg/2)*Memory/1000*KFlops/1000000"

## condor_bin_path - Path to Condor binaries. Must be set if Condor
## is used.
#condor_bin_path=/opt/condor/bin

## condor_bin_path - Path to Condor config file. Must be set if Condor
## is used and the config file is not in its default location
## (/etc/condor/condor_config or ~/condor/condor_config).
## The full path to the file should be given.
#condor_config=/opt/condor/etc/condor_config

### SGE
#lrms="sge"
## sge_bin_path - Path to Sun Grid Engine (SGE) binaries,
## MUST be set if SGE is the LRMS used
#sge_bin_path="/opt/n1ge6/bin/lx24-x86"

## sge_root - Path to SGE installation directory. MUST be set if SGE is used.
#sge_root="/opt/n1ge6"

## sge_cell - The name of the SGE cell to use. This option is only necessary
## in case SGE is set up with a cell name different from 'default'
#sge_cell="default"

## sge_qmaster_port, sge_execd_port - these options should be used in case SGE
## command line clients requre SGE_QMASTER_PORT and SGE_EXECD_PORT environment
## variables to be set. Usually they are not necessary.
#sge_qmaster_port="536"
#sge_execd_port="537"


### SLURM
#lrms="slurm"
## slurm_bin_path - Path to SLURM binaries, must be set if installed
## outside of normal $PATH
#slurm_bin_path="/usr/bin"

## How long should infosys wait before querying SLURM for new data (seconds)
#slurm_wakeupperiod="15"

## Should ARC use sacct instead of scontrol to get information about finished jobs
#slurm_use_sacct="yes"

### LSF
#lrms="lsf"
## the PATH to LSF bin folder
## no need to set if LSF is not used
#lsf_bin_path="/usr/local/lsf/bin/"

## the PATH to profile.lsf
## no need to set if LSF is not used
#lsf_profile_path="/usr/share/lsf/conf"


### LoadLeveler

#dgbridge_stage_dir="/var/www/DGBridge"

## Desktop Bridge url prefix pointing to dgbridge_stage_dir
#dgbridge_stage_prepend="http://edgi-bridge.example.com/DGBridge/"

### Boinc
#lrms="boinc"
## Connection strings for the boinc database
#boinc_db_host="localhost"
#boinc_db_port="3306"
#boinc_db_name="myproject"
#boinc_db_user="boinc"
#boinc_db_pass="password"


### Globus specifics
## globus_tcp_port_range, globus_udp_port_range - Firewall configuration
## In a firewalled environment the software which uses GSI needs to know what
## ports are available. The full documentation can be found at:
## http://dev.globus.org/wiki/FirewallHowTo
## These variable are similar to the Globus enviroment variables:
## GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE and GLOBUS_UDP_PORT_RANGE.
## These variables are not limited to [common], but can be set individually
## for each service in corresponding section: [grid-manager], [gridftpd]
## Example:
#globus_tcp_port_range="9000,12000"
#globus_udp_port_range="9000,12000"


### Certificates
## x509_user_cert, x509_user_key - Server credentials location.
## These variables are similar to the GSI enviroment variables:
## X509_USER_KEY and X509_USER_CERT
## These variables are not limited to [common], but can be set individually
## for each service in corresponding section: [grid-manager], [gridftpd], [nordugridmap]
#x509_user_key="/etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem"
#x509_user_cert="/etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem"

## x509_cert_dir - Location of trusted CA certificates
## This variable is similar to the GSI enviroment variable: X509_CERT_DIR
## This variable is not limited to [common], but can be set individually
## for each service in corresponding section: [grid-manager], [gridftpd]
#x509_cert_dir="/etc/grid-security/certificates"


### Authorization
## gridmap - The gridmap file location
## This variable is similar to the GSI enviroment variable: GRIDMAP
## This variable is not limited to [common], but can be set individually
## for each service in corresponding section: [grid-manager], [gridftpd]
## The default is /etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile
#gridmap="/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile"

## voms_processing - Defines how to behave if errors in VOMS AC processing detected.
##   relaxed - use everything that passed validation.
##   standard - same as relaxed but fail if parsing errors took place and
##              VOMS extension is marked as critical. This is a default.
##   strict - fail if any parsing error was discovered.
##   noerrors - fail if any parsing or validation error happened.
## This command can also be used in [grid-manager] and [griftpd] blocks.
#voms_processing="standard"

## voms_trust_chain - Define the DN chain that the host services trust when the
## voms AC from peer voms proxy certificate is parsed and validated.
## There can be multiple "voms_trust_chain" existing, each one corresponds to a voms server.
## This variable is similar to the information in *.lsc file, but with two differences:
##  1, you don't need to create a *.lsc file per VOMS server, but create a chain per VOMS server;
##  2, the regular expression is support when matching the DNs.
## This variable is not limited to [common], but can be used in [grid-manager]
## and [gridftpd] blocks.
## This variable should be used together with voms_processing.
## This variable will overwrite the information in *.lsc if *.lsc exists.
#voms_trust_chain = "/O=Grid/O=NorduGrid/CN=host/arthur.hep.lu.se" "/O=Grid/O=NorduGrid/CN=NorduGrid Certification Authority"
#voms_trust_chain = "/O=Grid/O=NorduGrid/CN=host/emi-arc.eu" "/O=Grid/O=NorduGrid/CN=NorduGrid Certification Authority"
#voms_trust_chain = "^/O=Grid/O=NorduGrid"


### [vo] block #####################################################
##
## [vo] block is used to define VOs and generate mapfiles from user
## list maintained by VO databases. VO block is a configuration block
## for the nordugridmap utility.
## Please note that [vo] block processing by nordugridmap utility
## depend on parameters defined in the [nordugridmap] block.
## [vo] block by itself does not affect authorization of client/user. For
## that label defined by vo="" atribute may be used in [group] block with
## 'vo' rule. Also mapfiles generated by nordugridmap utility can be used
## with 'file' rule.
##
#[vo]

## id blockid - specifies the unique configuration block id (this does not
## affect nordugridmap utility)
#id="vo_1"

## vo vo_name - specifies the VO name, this name can be used in other blocks.
## MUST be given.
#vo="nordugrid"

## file path - output gridmap-file where GENERATED mapping list will be
## stored. See parameters below to define how to generate this file.
## If the same file specified as output for different [vo] blocks,
## nordugridmap will automatically merge enrties in given blocks order.
## Default is '/etc/grid-security/gridmapfile'.
#file="/etc/grid-security/VOs/atlas-users"

## source url - the URL of the VO database which is assigned to this VO.
## The nordugridmap will use this URL to automatically generate and keep
## up-to-date userlist (mapfile) specified by the 'file' attribute.
##
## url is a multivalued attribute, several sources can be specified for
## the [vo] block and all the users from those sources will be merged
## into the same file. The source URLs are processed in the given order.
##
## Currently supported URL types are:
##    http(s):// - URL to plain text file. File should contain a list
##                 of DNs with optional issuer certificate authority DN
##                 (see require_issuerdn): "user DN" ["issuer DN"]
##    voms(s):// - URL to VOMS-Admin interface
##    nordugrid  - add NorduGrid VO members
##    ldap://    - expect LDAP-schema formatted VO Group
##    file://    - local file (stand-alone or dynamicaly generated by
##                 nordugridmap). File should contain a list of DNs with
##                 optional mapped unixid: "user DN" [mapped user ID]
##                 Result of optional mapped unixid processing depend
##                 on mapuser_processing option settings.
##    vo://      - reference to another [vo] configuration block
##    edg-mkgridmap://
##               - local configuration file used by edg-mkgridmap tool.
##                 nordugridmap will parse configuration from file and
##                 process it as additional [vo] block that will be refered
##                 authomatically in place URL specified. This allow
##                 easy migration from edg-mkgridmap solution without
##                 rewriting your previous configuration (NOTE that rarely
##                 used 'auth' directive and 'AUTO' mapping options are not
##                 supported)
##
## You can use either vo:// or file:// entries to specify dependencies
## between [vo] blocks, but using vo:// is a recommended way.
##
## For each separate source URL it is possible to override some parameters
## value. You can use the following syntax to perform this:
##    source="URL < parameter1=value1 parameter2=value2"
## You can override the following parameters:
##    mapped_unixid       for http(s),voms(s),ldap and file URLs
##    cache_enable        for http(s),voms(s),ldap and file URLs
##    voms_method         for voms(s) URLs
##    mapuser_processing  for file URLs with mapped_unixid='<unixid>' overrided
##                        (control mapped_unixid overriding behaviour for URL)
#source="vomss://voms.ndgf.org:8443/voms/nordugrid.org"
#source="vomss://lcg-voms.cern.ch:8443/voms/atlas?/atlas/Role=VO-Admin < mapped_unixid=atlasadmin"

#source="nordugrid"

## mapped_unixid unixid - the local UNIXID which is used in the generated
## grid-mapfile by the nordugridmap utility.
##
## If any of the sources have already provided mapping information (file://
## or vo://) behavior depends on 'mapuser_processing' [nordugridmap] block
## conguration:
##    mapuser_processing = 'overwrite': ignore already provided mapping and
##                         apply mapped_unixid for all sources
##    mapuser_processing = 'keep': apply mapped_unixid only for sources that
##                         does not already has mapping information
##
## [vo] block can only have one UNIXID
## If 'mapped_unixid' is not specified behavior depends on 'allow_empty_unixid'
## [nordugridmap] block conguration value:
##    allow_empty_unixid = 'yes': empty value will be used for mapped_unixid
##                         which means that nordugridmap will generate only
##                         the list of DNs without mapping (consider using
##                         mapuser_processing='overwrite' along with this
##                         option or sources that does not provide previously
##                         defined mapping information)
##    allow_empty_unixid = 'no': skip users without mapping information (if
##                         no mapping information provided by sources)
##
#mapped_unixid="gridtest"

## voms_fqan_map fqan unixid - the local UNIXID which is used to map voms(s)
## sources with specific FQAN given.
##
## Several voms_fqan_map can be specified for a [vo] block.
## For each voms(s) sources in [vo] block and every voms_fqan_map record
## separate source record will be authomatically generated with mapped_unixid
## overrided to specified one.
##
## Sources are generated in a given voms_fqan_map order. Original voms(s) source
## URL are processed LAST.
##
## This allows to simplify configuration, especially in redundancy cases when
## several VOMS servers are used for the same VO.
##
#voms_fqan_map="/atlas/Role=VO-Admin atlasadmin"
#voms_fqan_map="/atlas/Role=production atlasprod"

## require_issuerdn yes/no - another nordugridmap option. YES would map only
## those DNs obtained from the urls which have the corresponding public CA
## packages installed. Default is 'no'.
##
## Note, that some sources does not provide issuer information (like
## voms(s):// or file://). If this sources are used within [vo] block
## and require_issuerdn is set to 'yes' behavior depends on issuer_processing
## [nordugridmap] block conguration:
##    issuer_processing = 'relaxed': check only those records that have issuer
##                        information provided, allow other sources
##    issuer_processing = 'strict': if issuer information was not found record
##                        is filtered and will not be passed into mapfile
##
#require_issuerdn="no"

## filter  ACL string - An ACL filter for the nordugridmap utility. Multiple
## allow/deny statements are possible. The fetched DNs are filtered against
## the specified rules before they are added to the generated mapfile.
##
## * can be used as a wildcard. You may run the nordugridmap with the --test
## command line option to see how the filters you specified work.
##
## If at least one allow filter is specified implicit deny is used at the end
## of ACL. If only deny filters are present - implicit allow used at the end.
#filter="deny  *infn*"
#filter="allow *NorduGrid*"


######################################################################


### [group] Authorisation block ######################################
##
## These configuration blocks define rules used to define to which
## authorization group a user belongs. The group should not be mistaken
## for a virtual organisation (VO). A group may match a single vo if
## only a single check (rule) on vo membership is perfomed. It is
## however more common to allow multiple VOs in a single group. ARC
## also allows many other ways to assign users to groups. Technically,
## permissions are only granted to groups, not directly to VOs.
##
## The block specifies single authorization group. Ther may be multiple
## [group] blocks in configuration defining multiple authorization
## groups.
##
## The block can be specified in two ways - either using [group/group1]
## like subblock decalration per group or just [group]. The two formats
## are equivalent. Every block (till the beginning of next block or the
## end of the file) defines one authorization group.
##
## IMPORTANT: Rules in a group are processed in their order of appearance.
## The first matching rule decides the membership of a  the user to a group
## and the processing STOPS. There are positively and negatively matching
## rules. If a rule is matched positively then the user tested is accepted
## into the respective group and further processing is stopped. Upon a
## negative match the user would be rejected for that group - processing
## stops too. The sign of rule is determined by prepending the rule with
## '+' (for positive) or '-' (for negative) signs. '+' is default and can
## be omitted. A rule may also be prepended with '!' to invert result of rule,
## which will let the rule match the complement of users. That complement
## operator ('!') may be combined with the operator for positive or negative
## matching.
##
## A group MUST be defined before it may be used. In this respect the
## arc.conf is ORDER SENSITIVE.
##
## The authorization groups can be used in [gridftpd]
## and in its sub-blocks. The syntax of their specification varies with
## the service they are used for.
## For using authorization groups and VO blocks in HED framework please
## read "Security Framework of ARC" at
## http://www.nordugrid.org/documents/arc-security-documentation.pdf
##
#[group]

## name group_name - Specify name of group. If there is no such command
##  in block, name of subblock is used instead (that is what subblocks
##  are used for). For example [group/users]
#name="users"

## subject certificate_subject - Rule to match specific subject of user's
## X.509 certificate. No masks, patterns and regular expressions are allowed.
## For more information about X.509 refer to http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/X509
#subject="/O=Grid/O=Big VO/CN=Main Boss"

## file path - Start reading rules from another file. That file has a bit
##  different format. It can't contain blocks and commands are separated
##  from arguments by space. Also word "subject" in subject command may be
##  skipped. That makes it convinient to directly add gridmap-like lists to
##  authorization group.
#file="/etc/grid-security/local_users"

## voms vo group role capabilities - Match VOMS attribute in user's credential.
##  Use '*' to match any value. More information about VOMS can be found at
##  http://grid-auth.infn.it
#voms="nordugrid Guests * *"

## group group_name [group_name ...] - Match user already belonging to one
##  of specified groups. Groups refered here must be defined earlier in
##  configuration file. Multiple group names may be specified for this rule.
##  That allows creating hierarchical structure of authorization groups like
##   'clients' are those which are 'users' and 'admins'.
#group="local_admins"

## plugin timeout path [argument ...] - Run external executable or
##  function from shared library. Rule is matched if plugin returns 0.
##  In arguments following substitutions are supported:
##   %D - subject of certicate
##   %P - path to proxy
##  For more about plugins read documentation.
#plugin="10 /opt/external/bin/permis %P"

## lcas library directory database - Call LCAS functions to check rule.
##  Here library is path to shared library of LCAS, either absolute or
##  relative to directory; directory is path to LCAS installation directory,
##  equivalent of LCAS_DIR variable; database is path to LCAS database,
##  equivalent to LCAS_DB_FILE variable. Each arguments except library is
##  optional and may be either skipped or replaced with ’*’.
#lcas=""

## remote URL ... - Check user's credentials against remote service. Only
##  DN groups stored at LDAP directories are supported. Multiple URLs are
##  allowed in this rule.
#remote="ldap://grid-vo.nordugrid.org/ou=People,dc=nordugrid,dc=org"

## vo vo_name ... - Match user belonging to VO specified by "vo=vo_name" as
##  configured in one of PREVIOUSLY defined [vo] blocks. Multiple VO names
##  are allowed for this rule.
#vo="nordugrid"

## all - Matches any user identity. This command requires no arguments but
##  still can be written as all="" or all= for consistency.
#all=""

### The [grid-manager] block #########################################
## The [grid-manager] block configures the part of A-REX service hosted
## in *arched* and taking care of the grid tasks on the frontend
## (stagein/stageout, LRMS job submission, caching, etc..). Name of this
## block is historical and comes from times then this functionality was
## handled by separate process called grid-manager. This section also
## configures WS interfaces of A-REX service also hosted by same container.
#[grid-manager]

## controldir path - The directory of the A-REX's internal job log files,
## not needed on the nodes. <must be set>
#controldir="/var/spool/nordugrid/jobstatus"

## sessiondir path [drain] - the directory which holds the sessiondirs of the grid jobs.
## Multiple session directories may be specified by specifying multiple sessiondir
## commands. In this case jobs are spread evenly over the session directories.
## If sessiondir="*" is set, the session directory will be spread over the
## ${HOME}/.jobs directories of every locally mapped unix user. It is preferred
## to use common session directories. The path may be followed by "drain", in
## which case no new jobs will be assigned to that sessiondir, but current jobs
## will still be processed and accessible. <sessiondir must be set>
#sessiondir="/scratch/grid"
#sessiondir="/mnt/grid drain"

## runtimedir path - The directory which holds the runtimeenvironment scripts,
## should be available on the nodes as well! the runtimeenvironments are
## automatically detected and advertised in the information system.
#runtimedir="/SOFTWARE/runtime"

## scratchdir path - path on computing node to move session directory to before
## execution. If defined should contain the path to the directory on the
## computing node which can be used to store a jobs' files during execution.
## Sets the environment variable RUNTIME_LOCAL_SCRATCH_DIR. Default is not to
## move session directory before execution.
#scratchdir="/local/scratch/"

## shared_scratch path - path on frontend where scratchdir can be found. If
## defined should contain the path corresponding to that set in scratchdir as
## seen on the frontend machine. Sets the environment variable
## RUNTIME_FRONTEND_SEES_NODE.
#shared_scratch="/mnt/scratch"

## nodename path - command to obtain hostname of computing node.
#nodename="/bin/hostname"

## cachedir cache_path [link_path] - specifies a directory to store cached
## data. Multiple cache directories may be specified by specifying multiple
## cachedir commands. Cached data will be distributed evenly over the caches.
## Specifying no cachedir command or commands with an empty path disables caching.
## Optional link_path specifies the path at which the cache_path is accessible on
## computing nodes, if it is different from the path on the A-REX host.
## Example: cache="/shared/cache /frontend/jobcache"
## If "link-path" is set to '.' files are not soft-linked, but copied to session
## directory. If a cache directory needs to be drained, then cachedir
## should specify "drain" as the link path, in which case no new files will be
## added to the cache.
#cachedir="/scratch/cache"
#cachedir="/fs1/cache drain"

## remotecachedir cache_path [link_path] - specifies caches which are under
## the control of other A-REXs, but which this A-REX can have read-only access to.
## Multiple remote cache directories may be specified by specifying multiple
## remotecachedir commands. If a file is not available in paths specified by
## cachedir, A-REX looks in remote caches. link_path has the same meaning as in
## cachedir, but the special path ``replicate'' means files will
## be replicated from remote caches to local caches when they are requested.
#remotecachedir="/mnt/fs1/cache replicate"

## cachesize max min - specifies high and low watermarks for space used
## by cache, as a percentage of the space on the file system on which
## the cache directory is located. When the max is exceeded, files will
## be deleted to bring the used space down to the min level. It is a
## good idea to have the cache on its own separate file system. To turn
## off this feature "cachesize" without parameters can be specified.
#cachesize="80 70"

## If cache cleaning is enabled, files accessed less recently than the given
## time period will be deleted. Example values of this option are 1800, 90s, 24h,
## 30d. When no suffix is given the unit is seconds.
#cachelifetime="30d"

## cacheshared yes|no - specifies whether the caches share a filesystem with
## other data. If set to yes then cache-clean calculates the size of the cache
## instead of using filesystem used space.
#cacheshared="yes"

## cachespacetool path [options] - specifies an alternative tool to "df" that
## cache-clean should use to obtain space information on the cache file system.
## The output of this command must be "total_bytes used_bytes". The cache
## directory is passed as the last argument to this command.
#cachespacetool="/etc/getspace.sh"

## cachelogfile path - specifies the filename where output of the cache-clean
## tool should be logged. Defaults to /var/log/arc/cache-clean.log.
#cachelogfile="/tmp/cache-clean.log"

## tool, between 0 (FATAL) and 5 (DEBUG). Defaults to 3 (INFO).
#cacheloglevel="4"

## cachecleantimeout time - the timeout in seconds for running the cache-clean
## tool. If using a large cache or slow file system this value can be
## increased to allow the cleaning to complete. Defaults to 3600 (1 hour).
#cachecleantimeout="10000"

## cacheaccess rule - rules for allowing access to files in the cache remotely
## through the A-REX web interface. A rule has three parts:
## 1. Regular expression defining a URL pattern
## 2. Credential attribute to match against a client's credential
## 3. Credential value to match against a client's credential
## A client is allowed to access the cached file if a URL pattern matches the
## cached file URL and the client's credential has the attribute and value
## required for that pattern. Possible values for credential attribute are dn,
## voms:vo, voms:role and voms:group. Remote cache access requires that the
## A-REX web interface is enabled via arex_mount_point.
#cacheaccess="gsiftp://host.org/private/data/.* voms:vo myvo:production"
#cacheaccess="gsiftp://host.org/private/data/bob/.* dn /O=Grid/CN=Bob"

## enable_cache_service yes|no - Turn on or off the cache service interface.
## If turned on the cache service must be installed and the A-REX WS interface

## wslogfile path - Specify log file location for WS-interface operations. This
## file is only created if the WS-interface is enabled through the
## arex_mount_point option. The logsize, logreopen and debug options also apply
## to this file. If using an external log rotation tool be careful to make sure
## it matches the path specified here. It is possible to specify the same file
## as logfile to combine the logs. Default is /var/log/arc/ws-interface.log
#wslogfile="/var/log/arc/ws-interface.log"

## logsize size [number] - 'Size' specifies in bytes how big log file is
##  allowed to grow (approximately). If log file exceeds specified size
##  it is renamed into logfile.0. And logfile.0 is renamed into
##  logfile.1, etc. up to 'number' logfiles. Don't set logsize if you don't
##  want to enable the ARC logrotation because another logrotation tool is used.
#logsize="100000 2"

## logreopen yes|no - Specifies if log file must be closed after each record is
## added. By default arched keeps log file open. This option can be used to
## make behavior of arched compatible with external log rotation utilities.

## jobreport [url ...] [timeout] - tells to report all started and finished jobs
## to logger service at 'url'. Multiple urls and multiple jobreport commands
## are allowed. In that case the job info will be sent to all of them.
## Timeout specifies how long (in days) to try to pass information before
## give up. Suggested value is 30 days.
#jobreport="https://grid.uio.no:8001/logger"

## jobreport_vo_filters [VO URL[,VO URL]...] - it is a filter option
## where can be set which VO will be send to the configured jobreport server.
## When add new URL here (that no exist in the list of jobreport) need to
## add this URL into the jobreport element. Multiple VO's are allowed BUT
## only just one jobreport_vo_filters is allowed.
#jobreport_vo_filters="vo1 url1, vo2 url2"

## jobreport publisher - name of the accounting records publisher.
#jobreport_publisher="jura"

## jobreport credentials path [key_file [cert_file [ca_dir]]] - specifies the

## wakeupperiod time - specifies how often A-REX cheks for new jobs
## arrived, job state change requests, etc. That is resposivity of
## A-REX. 'time' is time period in seconds. Default is 3 minutes.
## Usually this command is not needed because important state changes
## are also trigering out-of-schedule checks.
## NOTE: This parameter does not affect responsivity of backend scripts -
## especially scan-*-job. That means that upper estimation of time for
## detecting job finished executing is sum of responsivity of backend
## script + wakeupperiod.
#wakeupperiod="180"

## defaultttl [ttl [ttr]] - ttl is the time in seconds for how long a session
## directory will survive after job execution has finished. If not specified

## ARC is distributed with the plugin "inputcheck". It's purpose is
## to check if input files requested in job's RSL are accessible
## from this machine. It is better to run it before job enters cluster.
## It accepts 2 arguments: names of files containing RSL and credentials'
## proxy. This plugin is only guaranteed to work for job submitted through
## the legacy GridFTP interface, as this is the only interface for which
## credentials in the form of proxy certificate files are guaranteed to
## exist.
#authplugin="ACCEPTED 60 /usr/libexec/arc/inputcheck %C/job.%I.description %C/job.%I.proxy"

## ARC is distributed with the plugin "arc-vomsac-check". It's purpose is to enforce
## per-queue access policies based on VOMS attributes present in user's
## proxy-certificate. Plugin should be run before job enters the cluster.
## It requires 2 argments: path to job information .local file and path to
## credentials file.
## Enforced per-queue access policies are configured with 'ac_policy' option
## in the [queue/name] configuration block.
#authplugin="ACCEPTED 60 /usr/libexec/arc/arc-vomsac-check -L %C/job.%I.local -P %C/job.%I.proxy"

## localcred timeout plugin_path - Every time an external executable
## is run this plugin will be called. Its purpose is to set non-unix
## permissions/credentials on running tasks. Note: the process itself
## can still be run under the root account. If plugin_path looks like
## somename@somepath, then function 'somename' from the shared library
## located at 'somepath' will be called (timeout is not effective in
## that case).
## A-REX must be run as root to use this option.
## Comment it out unless you really know what you are doing.
#localcred="0 acquire@/opt/nordugrid/lib/afs.so %C/job.%I.proxy"

## norootpower yes|no - if set to yes, all job management proccesses

## A-REX. This program will be kept running under the account of the user
## specified by username. Currently only ’.’ is supported as username,
## corresponding to the user running A-REX. Every time this executable finishes
## it will be started again. This helper plugin mechanism can be used as an
## alternative to /etc/init.d or cron to (re)start external processes.

#http_proxy="proxy.mydomain.org:3128"

## fixdirectories yes|missing|no - specifies during startup A-REX should
## create all directories needed for it operation and set suitable default
## permissions. If "no" is specified then A-REX does nothing to prepare its
## operational environment. In case of "missing" A-REX only creates and
## sets permissions for directories which are not present yet.  For "yes"
## all directories are created and permisisons for all used directories are
## set to default safe values. Default behavior is as if "yes" is specified.
#fixdirectories="yes"

## arex_mount_point - enables web services interfaces, including
##  job execution and information system. The argument is
##  an https URL defining the endpoint port and path:
##      https://<hostname>:<port>/<path>
##  In order to submit job a client must specify the exact published
##  path. Make sure the chosen port is not blocked by firewall
##  or other security rules.

## If specified Argus is contacted for every operation requested
## through WS interface (see arex_mount_point).
#arguspep_endpoint="https://somehost.somedomain:8154/authz"

## arguspep_profile - defines which communication profile to use while communicationg
## with Argus PEPD service. Possible values are:
##  direct - pass all authorization attributes (only for debugging)
##  subject - pass only subject name of client
##  cream - makes A-REX pretend it is gLite CREAM service. This is
##    recommended profile for interoperability with gLite.

#arguspep_profile="cream"

## arguspep_usermap - specifies whether response from Argus service may define mapping
## of client to local account. Possible values are 'yes' and 'no'. Default is 'no'.
## Argus is contacted after all other user mapping is performed. Hence it can
## overwrite all other decisions.

## firewall - hostname or IP addres to use in response to PASV command
## instead of IP address of a network interface of computer.
#firewall="hostname"

## x509_user_cert, x509_user_key - Server credentials location
#x509_user_key="/etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem"
#x509_user_cert="/etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem"

## x509_cert_dir - Location of trusted CA certificates
#x509_cert_dir="/etc/grid-security/certificates"

## gridmap - The gridmap file location
## The default is /etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile
#gridmap="/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile"

## unixmap [unixname][:unixgroup] rule - more sophisticated way to map
##  Grid identity of client to local account. If client matches 'rule'
##  it's assigned specified unix identity or one generated by rule.
##  Mapping commands are processed sequentially and processing stops
##  at first successful one (like in [group] section). For possible rules
##  read "ARC Computing Element. System Administrator guide" manual. All
##  rules defined in [group] section canbe used. There are also additional
##  rules which produce not only yes/no result but also give back user and
##  group names to which mapping should happen. The way it works is quite
##  complex so it is better to read full documentation.
##  For safety reasons if sophisticated mapping is used it is better to
##  finish mapping sequence with default mapping to nonexistent or safe
##  account.
#unixmap="nobody:nogroup all"

## unixgroup group rule - do mapping only for users belonging to
##  specified authorization 'group'. It is similar to an additional filter
##  for unixmap command which filters out all users not belonging to specified
##  authorization group. Only rules which generate unix user and group names
##  may be used in this command. Please read "ARC Computing Element System
##  Administrator Guide" for more information.
#unixgroup="users simplepool /etc/grid-security/pool/users"

## unixvo vo rule - do mapping only for users belonging to specified VO.
## Only rules which generate unix identity name may be used in this command.
## Please read "ARC Computing Element. System Administrator Guide" for more
## information. This command is similar to 'unixgroup' described above and
## exists for convenience for setups which base mapping on VOs users belong to.
#unixvo="ATLAS unixuser atlas:atlas"

### [gridftpd/filedir] block #####################################
##
## [gridftpd/filedir] "fileplugin" storage block
## subblock for "exporting" a directory using the gridftpd's fileplugin plugin.
## gridftp plugins are shared libraries.
## "filedir" is a unique label. The access control is set by using the
## "dir" config option
##
#[gridftpd/filedir]

## plugin name - specifies name of shared library to be loaded relative to
## "pluginpath".
## The next line is MUST for a gridftp file server with "fileplugin", don't
## change anything
#plugin="fileplugin.so"

## groupcfg group_name [group_name ...] - specifies authorization groups
## for which this plugin is activated. In case groupcfg is not used the
## plugin is loaded for every mapped grid user. Multiple names were
## may be specified delimited by blank space. Group names are as specified
## in [group] sections.
#groupcfg="users"

## the name of the virtual directory served by the gridftp server, REQUIRED
## the exported storage area is accessable as gsiftp://my_server/topdir.
## "topdir" is just an example, call the virtual path anything you like,
## even "/" is a valid choice.
#path="/topdir"

## the physical directory corresponding to the virtual one:
## gsiftp://my_server/topdir will give access to the
## /scratch/grid directory on my_server, REQUIRED
#mount="/scratch/grid"

## dir - this is the access control parameter, you can have several "dir" lines
## controlling different directories within then same block
##
##  dir path options  - specifies access rules for accessing files in 'path'
##           (relative to virtual and real path) and all the files and directories below.
##  'options' are:
##       nouser  - do not use local file system rights, only use those
##                 specifies in this line
##       owner   - check only file owner access rights
##       group   - check only group access rights
##       other   - check only "others" access rights
##   if none of the above specified usual unix access rights are applied.
##       read    - allow reading files
##       delete  - allow deleting files
##       append  - allow appending files (does not allow creation)
##       overwrite - allow overwriting already existing files (does not
##                 allow creation, file attributes are not changed)
##       dirlist - allow obtaining list of the files
##       cd      - allow to make this directory current
##       create owner:group permissions_or:permissions_and  - allow creating
##                 new files. File will be owned by 'owner' and owning group
##                 will be 'group'. If '*' is used, the user/group to which
##                 connected user is mapped will be used. The permissions
##                 will be set to permissions_or & permissions_and. (second
##                 number is reserved for the future usage).
##
##       mkdir owner:group permissions_or:permissions_and  - allow creating new directories.
## some examples:
## Set permissions on mounted directory
#dir="/ nouser read cd dirlist delete create *:* 664:664 mkdir *:* 775:775"
## Adjust permissions on some subdirectories
#dir="/section1 nouser read mkdir *:* 700:700 cd dirlist"

### [infosys] block ################################################
## [infosys] block configures the hosting environment of the
## Information services (Local Info Tree, Index Service, Registrations,
## see the Information System manual) provided by the
## OpenLDAP slapd server.
#[infosys]

## infosys_compat - Setting this variable will cause ARC to use the old
## infoproviders.
## NOTE: this only applies to ARC < 13.11. Old infoproviders
## have been REMOVED from release 13.11 on.
##Basically, the new version uses A-REX to create LDIF
## while the old version uses a BDII provider-script to do it. The new
## version is required for GLUE2 output.
#infosys_compat="disable"

## infoproviders_timeout - this only applies to new infoproviders.
## it changes A-REX behaviour with respect to a single infoprovider run.
## Increase this value if you have many jobs in the controldir and
## infoproviders need more time to process.
## The value is in seconds.
## Default is 1200 seconds.
#infoproviders_timeout="1200"

## validity_ttl - allows the sysadmin to define a specific validity
## time for the records in the information system. The number is in
## seconds. This number appears "as is" in the GLUE2 Validity fields.
## Default is 600 seconds.
#validity_ttl="600"

## debug - sets the debug level/verbosity of the startup script {0 or 1}.
## Default is 0.
#debug="1"

### Openldap specifics
## hostname - the hostname of the machine running the slapd service
## will be the bind for slapd. If not present, will be
## taken from the [common] block or guessed
#hostname="my.testbox"

## port - the port where the slapd service runs. Default infosys port is 2135.
#port="2135"

## slapd_loglevel - sets the native slapd loglevel (see man slapd).
## Slapd logs via syslog. The default is set to no-logging (0) and it is
## RECOMMENDED not to be changed in a production environment.
## Non-zero slap_loglevel value causes serious performance decrease.
#slapd_loglevel="0"

## slapd_hostnamebind - may be used to set the hostname part of the
## network interface to which the slapd process will bind. Most of
## the cases no need to set since the hostname config parameter is already
## sufficient. The default is empty. The example below will bind the slapd
## process to all the network interfaces available on the server.
#slapd_hostnamebind="*"

## threads - the native slapd threads parameter, default is 32. If you run an
## Index service too you should modify this value.
#threads="128"

## timelimit - the native slapd timelimit parameter. Maximum number of seconds
## the slapd server will spend answering a search request. Default is 3600.
## You probably want a much lower value.
#timelimit="1800"

## idletimeout - the native slapd idletimeout parameter. Maximum number of
## seconds the slapd server will wait before forcibly closing idle client
## connections. It's value must be larger than the value of "timelimit" option.
## If not set, it defaults to timelimit + 1.
#idletimeout="1800"

## ldap_schema_dir - allows to explicitly specify a path to the schema
## files. Note that this doesn't override standard location, but adds
## the specified path to the standard locations /etc/ldap and /etc/openldap.
## If you plan to relocate Glue1 and GLUE2 schemas, all these should be
## in the same directory that you specify here.
## this option does NOT apply to nordugrid.schema file. Such file has a
## release dependent location.
## Default is to use only standard locations described above.
#ldap_schema_dir="/nfs/ldap/schema/"

## oldconfsuffix .suffix - sets the suffix of the backup files of the
## low-level slapd config files in case they are regenerated. Default is
## ".oldconfig".
#oldconfsuffix=".oldconfig"

## overwrite_config yes|no - determines if the infosys startup scripts
## should generate new low-level slapd configuration files.  By default the
## low-level configuration files are regenerated with every server startup
## making use of the values specified in the arc.conf.
#overwrite_config="yes"


### Logging
## registrationlog path - specifies the logfile for the registration processes
## initiated by your machine. Default is "/var/log/arc/inforegistration.log"
#registrationlog="/var/log/arc/inforegistration.log"

## providerlog path - Specifies log file location for the information
## provider scripts. The feature is only available with >= 0.5.26 tag.
## Default is "/var/log/arc/infoprovider.log"
#providerlog="/var/log/arc/infoprovider.log"

## provider_loglevel - loglevel for the infoprovider scripts (0-5).
## The default is 1 (critical errors are logged)
#provider_loglevel="2"


### Other
## user unix_user - the unix user running the infosys processes such as
## the slapd, the registrations and infoprovider scripts.
## By default the ldap-user is used, you can run it as root if you wish.
## In case of non-root value you must make sure that the A-REX
## directories and their content are readable by the 'user' and the 'user'
## has access to the full LRMS information including jobs submitted by
## other users. The A-REX directories (controldir, sessiondir
## runtimedir, cachedir) are specified in the [grid-manager] block
#user="root"

## giis_location - If giis_location is not set, ARC_LOCATION will be
## used instead.
#giis_location="/usr/"

## infosys_ldap_run_dir - path where NorduGrid/GLUE2 LDAP ldif file
## will be generated, and where the fifo to sync between infoproviders
## and BDII will be generated. Default: /var/run/arc/infosys/
#infosys_ldap_run_dir="/var/run/arc/infosys/"

## These three variables decide which schema should be used for
## publishing data. They can all be enabled at the same time. Default is
## to enable nordugrid mds and disable glue.
## infosys_nordugrid - Enables NorduGrid schema
#infosys_nordugrid="enable"

## infosys_glue12 - Enables glue1.2/1.3 schema
## If infosys_glue12 is enabled, then resource_location,
## resource_latitude and resource_longitude need to be set in the
## [infosys/glue12] block. These variables do not have default values.
## The rest of the variables defaults are showcased below.
#infosys_glue12="disable"

## infosys_glue2 - Enables GLUE2 schema
#infosys_glue2_ldap="disable"

## infosys_glue2_ldap_showactivities - Enables GLUE2 ComputingActivities
## to appear in the LDAP rendering
## they're currently disabled by default.
#infosys_glue2_ldap_showactivities="disable"

## infosys_glue2_service_qualitylevel - Allows a sysadmin to define a
## different GLUE2 QualityLevel for A-REX.
## This can be used for operations.
## default: production
## Allowed value is one of: "production", "pre-production", "testing",
## "development"
## Refer to GLUE2 documentation for the meaning of these strings.
#infosys_glue2_service_qualitylevel="production"

### Slapd specific

## slapd - Configure where the slapd command is located, default is:
## /usr/sbin/slapd
#slapd="/usr/sbin/slapd"

## slapadd - Configure where the slapadd command is located, default is:
## /usr/sbin/slapadd
#slapadd="/usr/sbin/slapadd"


### BDII specific
## Starting from 11.05, Nordugrid ARC only supports BDII5.
## These variables are usually automatically set by ARC, and
## are here mostly for debug purposes and to tweak exotic
## BDII5 installations. In general, a sysadmin should not set these.

## bdii_debug_level - set the following to DEBUG to check bdii errors
## in bdii-update.log
## useful not to enable slapd logs reducing performance issues.
#bdii_debug_level="ERROR"

## provider_timeout - This variable allows a system administrator to
## modify the behaviour of bdii-update. This is the time BDII waits
## for the scripts generated by A-REX infoproviders to produce
## their output.
## Default is 300 seconds.
#provider_timeout=300

## infosys_debug - This variable disables/enables an ldap-database
## containing information about the ldap database itself on "o=infosys"
## it is very useful for debugging. Default is enabled.
#infosys_debug="disable"


## BDII5 uses these variables. These might change depending on BDII version.
## ARC sets them by inspecting distributed bdii configuration files.
## DO NOT CHANGE UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING

## bdii_location - The installation directory for the BDII.
## Default is /usr
#bdii_location="/usr"

## bdii_var_dir - Contains BDII pid files and slapd pid files
#bdii_var_dir="/var/run/arc/bdii"

## bdii_log_dir - Contains infosys logs

#bdii_tmp_dir="/var/tmp/arc/bdii"

## bdii_lib_dir - Contains slapd databases
#bdii_lib_dir="/var/lib/arc/bdii"

## bdii_update_pid_file, slapd_pid_file - Allows to change bdii-update
## and slapd pidfiles filename and location
#bdii_update_pid_file="/var/run/arc/bdii-update.pid"
#slapd_pid_file="$bdii_var_dir/db/slapd.pid"

## bdii_database - Configure what ldap database backend should be used,
## default is: bdb
#bdii_database="bdb"


## The following options are for tweaking only. Usually one should not
## configure them. They change the BDII configuration file generated
## by ARC.
## Please consult BDII manual for details.

## bdii_conf - Location of the bdii config file.
## ARC modifies the original and sets it
## as default /var/run/arc/infosys/bdii.conf
#bdii_conf="/var/run/arc/infosys/bdii.conf"

## Command line options used to run bdii-update.
## ARC finds it looking into bdii configuration.
## default: ${bdii_location}/sbin/bdii-update
#bdii_update_cmd
#bdii_archive_size
#bdii_db_config
#bdii_breathe_time
#bdii_delete_delay
#bdii_read_timeout
#bdii_run_dir
#bindmethod
#cachettl
#db_archive
#db_checkpoint

## EGIIS-related commands

## giis_fifo - path to fifo used by EGIIS.
## default is /var/run/arc/giis-fifo
## This file is automatically created by ARC, the option
## is only for tweaking.
#giis_fifo=/var/run/arc/giis-fifo


## LDAP parameters of the cluster.pl (old) infoprovider, use the defaults,
## do NOT change them unless you know what you are doing

## cachetime affects old infoproviders, and forces the validity time of the record.
#cachetime="30"

## sizelimit affects registration to egiis
#sizelimit="10"

## slapd_cron_checkpoint - LDAP checkpoint enable/disable
## This option was introduced to solve bug #2032, to reduce the number
## of log files produced by BDII. It is usually not needed,
## but if BDII produces large logs and huge number of files,
## should help solving the issues related to that.
#slapd_cron_checkpoint="enable"

####################################################################
##
### [infosys/index/indexname] block ################################
##
## [infosys/index/indexname] Index Service block configures and enables
## an Information Index Service. A separate Index block is required for
## every Index Service you may run on the given machine.
## The 'indexname' constitutes to the
## 'mds-vo-name=indexname,o=grid' LDAP suffix characterizing the Index Service.
#[infosys/index/indexname]

## name - The unique (within the hosting machine) name of the
## Index Service. Its value becomes part of the LDAP suffix
## of the Index Service:
## (mds-vo-name=value of the name attribute, o=grid)
#name="indexname"

## allowregistration - Implements registration filtering within an Index Sevice
## Sets the Local Information Trees or lower level Index Services
## allowed to register to the Index Service. List each allowed registrants
## with the allowreg atribute.
## WARNING: specifying allowreg implies setting up a strict filtering,
## only the matching registrants will be able to register to the Index.
## The wildcard * can be used in allowreg. Several allowreg lines can be used.
## Some examples:
## -All the Swedish machines can register regardless they are resources or Indices
## allowreg="*.se:2135"
## -Cluster resources from Denmark can register
## allowreg="*.dk:2135/nordugrid-cluster-name=*, Mds-Vo-name=local, o=grid"
## -Storage resources from HIP, Finland can register
## allowreg="*hip.fi:2135/nordugrid-se-name=*, Mds-Vo-name=local, o=grid"
## -The index1.sweden.se can register as a Sweden Index  (and only as a Sweden Index)
## allowreg="index1.sweden.se:2135/Mds-vo-Name=Sweden,o=Grid"
## -Any Index Service can register
## allowreg="*:2135/Mds-vo-Name=*,o=Grid"

#registranthostname="myhost.org"

## registrantport - the port of the slapd service hosting the
## registrant Index Service. The attribute inherits its value from the
## [infosys] block (and therefore defaults to 2135)
#registrantport="2135"

## registrantsuffix - the LDAP suffix of the registrant Index Service.
## It is automatically determined from the registration block name,
## therefore most of the cases no need to specify.
## In this case the default registrantsuffix will be:
##                  "Mds-Vo-name=indexname"
## please mind uppercase/lowercase characters in the above string
## when defining allowreg in an index!
## Don't set it unless you want to overwrite the default.

## respect to  cputype, memory, installed software (opsys). The frontend is NOT
## needed to be homogeneous with the nodes. In case of inhomogeneous nodes, try
## to arrange the nodes into homogeneous groups assigned to a queue and use
## queue-level attributes. Possible values: True,False, the default is True.
## False will trigger multiple GLUE2 ExecutionEnvironments to be published
## if applicable.
#homogeneity="True"

## architecture - sets the hardware architecture of the NODES. The "architecture"
## is defined as the output of the "uname -m" (e.g. i686). Use this cluster
## attribute if only the NODES are homogeneous with respect to the architecture.
## Otherwise the queue-level attribute may be used for inhomogeneous nodes. If
## the frontend's architecture agrees to the nodes, the "adotf" (Automatically
## Determine On The Frontend) can be used to request automatic determination.
#architecture="adotf"

## opsys - this multivalued attribute is meant to describe the operating system
## of the computing NODES. Set it to the opsys distribution of the NODES and not
## the frontend! opsys can also be used to  describe the kernel or libc version
## in case those differ from the originally shipped ones. The distribution name
## should be given as distroname-version.number, where spaces are not allowed.
## Kernel version should come in the form kernelname-version.number.
## If the NODES are inhomogeneous with respect to this attribute do NOT set it on
## cluster level, arrange your nodes into homogeneous groups assigned to a queue
## and use queue-level attributes.
#opsys="Linux-2.6.18"
#opsys="glibc-2.5.58"
#opsys="CentOS-5.6"

## nodecpu - this is the cputype of the homogeneous nodes. The string is
## constructed from the /proc/cpuinfo  as  the value of "model name"  and "@" and
## value of "cpu MHz". Do NOT set this attribute on cluster level if the NODES
## are inhomogeneous with respect to cputype, instead arrange the nodes into
## homogeneous groups assigned to a queue and use queue-level attributes. Setting
## the nodecpu="adotf" will result in Automatic Determination On The Frontend,
## which should only be used if the frontend has the same cputype as the
## homogeneous nodes.
#nodecpu="AMD Duron(tm) Processor @ 700 MHz"

## nodememory - this is the amount of memory (specified in MB) on the node
## which can be guaranteed to be available for the application. Please note
## in most cases it is less than the physical memory installed in the nodes.
## Do NOT set this attribute on cluster level if the NODES are inhomogeneous
## with respect to their memories, instead arrange the nodes into homogeneous
## groups assigned to a queue and use queue-level attributes.
#nodememory="512"

## defaultmemory - If a user submits a job without specifying how much
## memory should be used, this value will be taken first. The order is:
## xrsl -> defaultmemory -> nodememory -> 1GB. This is the amount of
## memory (specified in MB) that a job will request(per rank).
#defaultmemory="512"

## benchmark name value - this optional multivalued attribute can be used to
## specify benchmark results on the cluster level. Use this cluster attribute
## if only the NODES are homogeneous with respect to the benchmark performance.
## Otherwise the similar queue-level attribute should be used. Please try to
## use one of standard benchmark names given below if possible.
#benchmark="SPECINT2000  222"
#benchmark="SPECFP2000 333"

## middleware - the multivalued attribute shows the installed grid software on
## the cluster, nordugrid and globus-ng  is automatically set, no need to specify
## middleware=nordugrid or middleware=globus
#middleware="my grid software"

## nodeaccess - determines how the nodes can connect to the internet. Not setting
## anything means the nodes are sitting on a private isolated network. "outbound"
## access means the nodes can connect to the outside world while "inbound" access
## means the nodes can be connected from outside. inbound & outbound access
## together means the nodes are sitting on a fully open network.
#nodeaccess="inbound"
#nodeaccess="outbound"

## dedicated_node_string - the string which is used in the PBS node config to
## distinguish the grid nodes from the rest. Suppose only a subset of nodes are
## available for grid jobs, and these nodes have a common "node property" string,
## this case the dedicated_node_string should be set to this value and only the
## nodes with the corresponding  "pbs node property" are counted as grid enabled
## nodes. Setting the dedicated_node_string  to the value of the "pbs node
## property" of the grid-enabled  nodes will influence how the totalcpus, user
## freecpus is calculated. You don't need to set this attribute if your cluster
## is fully available for the grid and your cluster's PBS config does not use
## the "node property" method to assign certain nodes to grid queues. You
## shouldn't use this config option unless you make sure  your PBS config makes
## use of the above described setup.
#dedicated_node_string="gridnode"

## localse - this multivalued parameter tells the BROKER that certain URLs (and
## locations below that) should be considered "locally" available to the cluster.
#localse="gsiftp://my.storage/data1/"
#localse="gsiftp://my.storage/data2/"

## gm_mount_point - this is the same as the "path" from the [gridftpd/jobs]
## block. The default is "/jobs". Will be cleaned up later, do NOT touch it.
#gm_mount_point="/jobs"

## gm_port - this is the same as the "port" from the [gridftpd] block. The
## default is "2811". Will be cleaned up later.
#gm_port="2811"

## cpudistribution - this is the CPU distribution over nodes
## given in the form: ncpu:m where
##   n is the number of CPUs per machine
##   m is the number of such computers
## Example: 1cpu:3,2cpu:4,4cpu:1 represents a cluster with
## 3 single CPU machines, 4 dual CPU machines, one machine with 4 CPUs.
## This command is needed to tweak and overwrite the values returned
## by the underlying LRMS. In general there is no need to configure it.
#cpudistribution=1cpu:3,2cpu:4,4cpu:1

### [queue/queue_name] block #######################################
##
## Each grid-enabled queue should have a separate queue block.
## The queuename should be used as a label in the block name.
## A queue can represent a PBS/LSF/SGE/SLURM/LL queue, a SGE pool, a Condor
## pool or a single machine in case 'fork' type of LRMS is specified in
## the [common] block.
## Queues don't need to be registerd (there is no queue registration block),
## once you configured your cluster to register to an Index Service
## the queue entries (configured with this block) automatically will be there.
## Please consult the ARC Information System manual for detailed information
## on queue attributes:
##   http://www.nordugrid.org/documents/arc_infosys.pdf
##
## use the queue_name for labeling the block. The special name 'fork' should be
## used for labeling the queue block in case you specified 'fork' type of
## LRMS in the [common] block.
#[queue/gridlong]

## name sets the name of the grid-enabled queue. It MUST match the queue_name
## label of the corresponding queue block, see above.
## Use "fork" if you specified 'fork' type of LRMS in the [common] block.
## Queue name MUST be specified, even if the queue block is already correctly
## labeled.
#name="gridlong"

## homogeneity - determines whether the queue consists of identical NODES with
## respect to  cputype, memory, installed software (opsys).
## In case of inhomogeneous nodes, try to arrange the nodes into homogeneous
## groups and assigned them to a queue.
## Possible values: True,False, the default is True.
#homogeneity="True"

## scheduling_policy - this optional parameter tells the schedulling policy of
## the queue, PBS by default offers the FIFO scheduller, many sites run the MAUI.
## At the moment FIFO & MAUI is supported. If you have a MAUI scheduller you
## should specify the "MAUI" value since it modifies the way the queue resources
## are calculated.  BY default the "FIFO" sceduller is assumed.
#scheduling_policy="FIFO"

## comment - a free text field for additional comments on the queue in a single
## line, no newline character is allowed!
#comment="This queue is nothing more than a condor pool"

## maui_bin_path - set this parameter for the path of the maui commands like
## showbf in case you specified the "MAUI"  scheduling_policy above. This
## parameter can be set in the [common] block as well.
#maui_bin_path="/usr/local/bin"

## queue_node_string - In PBS you can assign nodes to a queue (or a queue to
## nodes) by using the "node property" PBS node config method and asssigning the
## marked nodes to the queue (setting the resources_default.neednodes =
## queue_node_string for that queue). This parameter should contain the "node
## property" string of the queue-assigned nodes. Setting the queue_node_string
## changes how the queue-totalcpus, user freecpus are determined for this queue.
## Essentially, queue_node_string value is used to construct nodes= string in
## PBS script, such as nodes=count:queue_node_string where count is taken from
## the job description (1 if not specified). You shouldn't use this option unless
## you are sure that your PBS configuration makes use of the above configuration.
## Read NorduGrid PBS instructions for more information:
##    http://www.nordugrid.org/documents/pbs-config.html
#queue_node_string="gridlong_nodes"
#queue_node_string="ppn=4:ib"

## sge_jobopts - additional SGE options to be used when submitting jobs to SGE
## from this queue.  If in doubt, leave it commented out
#sge_jobopts="-P atlas -r yes"

## condor_requirements - only needed if using Condor. It needs to be defined for
## each queue. Use this option to determine which nodes belong to the current
## queue.  The value of 'condor_requirements' must be a valid constraints string
## which is recognized by a condor_status -constraint '....' command. It can
## reference pre-defined ClassAd attributes (like Memory, Opsys, Arch, HasJava,
## etc) but also custom ClassAd attributes.  To define a custom attribute on a
## condor node, just add two lines like the ones below in the `hostname`.local
## config file on the node:
##   NORDUGRID_RESOURCE=TRUE
##   STARTD_EXPRS = NORDUGRID_RESOURCE, $(STARTD_EXPRS)
## A job submitted to this queue is allowed to run on any node which satisfies
## the 'condor_requirements' constraint.  If 'condor_requirements' is not set,
## jobs will be allowed to run on any of the nodes in the pool. When configuring
## multiple queues, you can differentiate them based on memory size or disk
## space, for example:
##
#condor_requirements="(OpSys == "linux" && NORDUGRID_RESOURCE && Memory >= 1000 && Memory < 2000)"

## CPU architecture to request when submitting jobs to LSF. Use only if you know
## what you are doing.
#lsf_architecture="PowerPC"

## totalcpus - manually sets the number of cpus assigned to the queue. No need to
## specify the parameter in case the queue_node_string method was used to assign
## nodes to the queue (this case it is dynamically calculated and the static
## value is overwritten) or when the queue have access to the entire cluster
## (this case the cluster level totalcpus is the relevant parameter). Use this
## static parameter only if some special method is applied to assign a subset of
## totalcpus to the queue.
#totalcpus="32"

## queue-level configuration parameters: nodecpu, nodememory, architecture, opsys
## and benchmark should be set if they are homogeneous over the nodes assigned
## to the queue AND they are different from the cluster-level value.
## Their meanings are described in the cluster block. Usage: this queue collects
## nodes with "nodememory=512" while another queue has nodes with
## "nodememory=256" -> don't set the cluster attributes but use the queue-level
## attributes. When the frontend's architecture or cputype agrees with the queue
## nodes, the "adotf" (Automatically Determine On The Frontend) can be used to
## request automatic determination of architecture or nodecpu.
#nodecpu="adotf"
#nodememory="512"
#architecture="adotf"
#opsys="Fedora 16"
#opsys="Linux-3.0"
#benchmark="SPECINT2000  222"
#benchmark="SPECFP2000 333"

## queue access policy rules based on VOMS attributes in user's
## proxy certificate (requires the arc-vomsac-check plugin to be enabled).
## Matching rules have the following format:
##   ac_policy="[+/-]VOMS: <FQAN>"
## Please read arc-vomsac-check manual page for more information.
#ac_policy="-VOMS: /badvo"
#ac_policy="VOMS: /.*/Role=production"

## maxslotsperjob - this configures the GLUE2 MaxSlotsPerJob value
## on a particular queue (see GLUE2 definition).
## This value is usually generated by LRMS
## infocollectors, but there are cases in which a system administrator
## might like to tweak it.
## Default is to publish what is returned by the LRMS, and if nothing is
## returned, NOT to publish the MaxSlotsPerJob attribute.
## If a system administrator sets the value here, that value will be
## published instead, regardless of what the LRMS returns.
## Each LRMS might have a different meaning for this value.
#maxslotsperjob="5"

## authorizedvo - this attribute is used to advertise which VOs are authorized
## on each specific queue. Multiple entries are allowed.
## Add only one VO for each authorizedvo entry. Multiple VOs in the same line
## will cause errors.
## These entries will be shown in the MappingPolicy objects, that is, 
## they will apply for the Shares that corresponds to the queue.
## NOTE: if you have also configured authorizedvo in the [cluster] block,
## the result authorized VOs per queue is the union set of what is 
## contained in the [cluster] and in this [queue] block.
#authorizedvo="LocalUsers"
#authorizedvo="atlas"
#authorizedvo="community.nordugrid.org"

## LDAP parameters of the queue+jobs+users.pl (old) infoprovider, use the defaults,
## do NOT change them unless you know what you are doing

## this affects old infoproviders, and forces the validity time of the record.
#cachetime="30"

## sizelimit affects registration to EGIIS
#sizelimit="5000"
